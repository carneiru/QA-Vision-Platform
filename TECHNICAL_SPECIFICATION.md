# QEOS — Technical Specification (Current State)

Updated 2026-10-11. This document specifies the system **as it runs today**.
The target architecture lives in ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT_V1_0.md (see its
Implementation Status banner and adoption triggers); the delivery record is
TODO.md; the forward plan is IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md. The previous version of
this file duplicated Blueprint §5–§11 and described an unbuilt system.

## 1. System Overview

Five FastAPI services behind one NGINX gateway, a React SPA, a CLI collector
agent, and three background jobs — all on PostgreSQL 15, all deployed via the
repository-root docker-compose (production: the same stack on one VM behind a
Caddy TLS edge, `deploy/`, ADR-019).

```
qeos-collector (CI) ──► gateway ──► ingestion-service ──► ingestion_db
                               └──► test-management-service (Gherkin sync)
browser (dashboard SPA) ─► gateway ─► auth / organization / project / ingestion / test-management
jobs: ingestion-retention, analytics-rollup, weekly-summary (ingestion image, advisory locks)
```

All cross-service communication is synchronous HTTP: project-role checks
against project-service (which asks organization-service), user lookups on
auth-service's internal API, and the retention job on project-service's
internal API. Services never call each other for page data; the dashboard
joins (ADR-022, ADR-026). Outbound calls: GitHub (Run from QEOS), repository
providers (verification), notification webhooks and SMTP. No event bus exists
(Kafka is a blueprint target gated on the 1000+ events/s trigger). Every
service serves Prometheus `/metrics` (never routed by the gateway); ingestion also
exposes job heartbeats (`job_last_success_timestamp_seconds{job}`, from the
`job_heartbeats` table, migration 017). The monitoring stack that will scrape them is
in progress (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-10-monitoring-design.md`).

## 2. Services

### 2.1 auth-service (`platforms/auth-service/auth-service`)
- Registration with email verification (PendingRegistration → User on
  GET /auth/verify-email; unverified addresses are unclaimed).
- Login: JWT access token (60 min) + opaque refresh token (30 d, DB-stored,
  rotated on use, replay ⇒ every session revoked). Refresh token also set as
  httpOnly cookie `qeos_refresh` (Secure, SameSite=Strict, Path=/api/v1/auth);
  body token kept for API clients; `/auth/refresh-token` and `/auth/logout`
  accept body or cookie. The pre-rename cookie `qav_refresh` is still read when
  `qeos_refresh` is absent; every token issue clears it, and logout clears both
  cookies and revokes the session behind each.
- Password reset and change: `/auth/forgot-password` sends a single-use link
  (token stored SHA-256-hashed, 30 min); `/auth/reset-password`,
  `/auth/change-password`; a reset or change ends every session.
  `/auth/resend-verification` re-sends the registration link. Without SMTP the
  links are written to the service log.
- MFA (TOTP): `/auth/mfa/enroll|confirm|disable`; login answers
  `{mfa_required, mfa_token}` (5-min purpose-bound JWT) and
  `/auth/mfa/verify` completes with a TOTP or single-use recovery code
  (8 issued once, bcrypt-hashed). SSO sign-ins bypass MFA (IdP's factor).
- SSO: `/sso/google`, `/sso/microsoft` verify provider ID tokens
  (`{credential}`) against JWKS; Microsoft restricted to AZURE_ALLOWED_TENANTS;
  signing-key fetch hardened (timeout, throttled refresh; outages ⇒ 503).
  `/sso/github` is an honest 501. `/users/me/link/google|microsoft` links a
  provider to an existing account.
- Every service accepts only access tokens as sessions (MFA challenge, refresh
  and service tokens are rejected). `/internal/v1/users[/{id}]` (HTTP Basic,
  INTERNAL_API_PASSWORD; not routed by the gateway) serves organization-service.

### 2.2 organization-service
Organizations (soft delete), members (owner/admin/member/viewer/
billing_manager; only an owner grants or removes owner/admin), invitations
(7-day single-use token returned to the inviter — this service sends no email;
`GET /invitations/{token}` previews it for a signed-in user, then accept),
`GET /organizations` lists the caller's active memberships with role,
`GET /organizations/{id}/members/me` answers the caller's role for the other
services. Member lists carry emails from auth-service's internal API. Role
checks via JWT `sub` + membership.

### 2.3 project-service
Projects under organizations (access follows org roles), settings
(result_retention_days, default_environment, notify_on_failure), repositories
(GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps; checked against the provider's public API),
legal hold (owner/admin, with a required reason; retention deletes nothing of a
held project), internal retention endpoint (HTTP Basic, INTERNAL_API_PASSWORD)
consumed by the retention job.

### 2.4 ingestion-service
- **Collect**: `POST /collect/runs` with project API key (`qeos_` bearer; keys issued
  before the QEOS rename start with `qav_` and are still accepted).
  Validation (extra="forbid"), idempotency keys with body-hash replay
  detection, PII masking before truncation, server-computed counts, optional
  `changes` block (base ref + ≤1000 changed files; git name-status letters;
  null additions/deletions for binary), git metadata (author, message, PR,
  base branch), components under test (ADR-018). The receipt reports
  `quarantined`/`blocking` failures for `qeos-collector upload --gate`.
  `GET /collect/key` checks a key; `POST /collect/token` trades it for a
  5-minute service token that only test-management's import accepts (ADR-024).
- **Masking**: built-in rules (authorization headers, cookies, URL and CLI
  passwords, JWTs, vendor tokens, private keys, key=value secrets, emails, card
  numbers) plus up to 20 per-project patterns on RE2 (`/masking-patterns`, with
  a preview; ADR-020); `python -m src.ingestion.jobs.remask` re-masks stored
  results.
- **Read**: runs list per project (filters: branch, failing/passing, environment, CI, commit
  prefix, PR, author, started-at range), run detail with status filter and changed
  files, run summary, failures grouped by error signature, comparison of two
  runs. Access: user JWT + project role via project-service.
- **Analytics** (read roles): trends (`bucket=day|week|month`, Monday weeks,
  any IANA tz, ≤365 d), per-test list (sort/search/limit≤200/offset),
  history (encoded test_key), flaky (`window_days≤90`, min_runs,
  min_flip_rate, branch, include_muted), branches (per-branch aggregates),
  quarantine (`PUT/DELETE /flaky/mute`, edit roles: a quarantined test still
  runs and shows, but its failures do not fail a run or alert), latest-keys and
  run-strip (latest results for case lists), duration-estimate (Run from QEOS).
- **Report**: `POST /analytics/report` with sections summary, failure_causes,
  regressions, tests, duration over a period (ADR-026; the dashboard joins
  test-management's case areas for "by area" and coverage).
- **Notifications**: channels per project (Slack, Teams, https webhook, email
  to 1–5 addresses), on failed runs (branch filter) and/or a weekly summary;
  test button, last delivery recorded; SSRF guard (public addresses, no
  redirects); URLs never returned.
- **Export**: `GET /projects/{id}/export` streams everything stored for a
  project as NDJSON.
- **Jobs**: `ingestion-retention` (per-project retention, skips projects on
  legal hold, empties deleted projects after a 7-day grace, pg advisory lock
  7351001); `analytics-rollup` (flaky_daily backfill ≤90 d + yesterday/today
  every 6 h, lock 7351002); `weekly-summary` (Mondays, once per channel per
  week, lock 7351003).

### 2.5 test-management-service (`platforms/test-management-service`, ADR-022)
- **Cases**: per-project numbers shown as `TC-n` (never reused; archive, no delete), title,
  description, up to 50 `{action, expected}` steps, up to 20 lower-case labels, priority,
  status (draft/ready/archived), optional link to an automated test (`automated_test_key`, the
  ingestion `test_key`; the dashboard reads its latest result from ingestion).
- **Lists**: search (title), label (ANDed), status, priority, folder, feature, link and
  latest-result filters, paging (`GET /cases`, `POST /cases/search`); `GET /case-labels`,
  `/case-folders`, `/case-features` count what is in use; `GET /case-areas` gives every active
  case's areas for the report.
- **Gherkin** (ADR-023, ADR-024): `POST /cases/import` takes `.feature` files from the browser
  or from `qeos-collector import-features` (CI, default branch, service token); scenarios become
  cases keyed by file and scenario, a full import archives cases of missing files. `GET /features`
  and `/features/detail` serve the Feature view and page.
- **Run from QEOS** (ADR-025): `ci-target` holds the GitHub repository, workflow and branch, and
  a token encrypted at rest with Fernet (`TM_SECRETS_KEY`); `run-requests` dispatches the
  workflow (`workflow_dispatch`) for a case, a selection or a suite, tracks its status, stops it,
  stores the duration estimate, and lists run URLs for the report.
- **Suites**: unique name per project, ordered cases replaced as a whole by
  `PUT /suites/{id}/cases` (≤1000, unknown or repeated numbers are a 422); deleting a suite keeps
  its cases.
- Access: user JWT + project role via project-service (every role reads; owner/admin/member
  edit), the same contract as ingestion. The client is a copy of ingestion's (ADR-022).

## 3. Data

PostgreSQL 15; one database per service (auth_db, organization_db,
project_db, ingestion_db, testmgmt_db), created by db-init, migrated by per-service
Alembic jobs. Only the owning service writes its database; cross-domain
reads go through APIs (blueprint principle, enforced in practice).

Key ingestion tables: test_runs (+ change summary columns), test_results
(message/details masked+truncated, `(test_key, run_id)` index),
run_changed_files, run_components, muted_tests (quarantine), flaky_daily /
flaky_rollup_days (daily flip aggregates + computed-day markers), api_keys
(SHA-256 of the key), masking_patterns, notification_channels. Test-management:
cases, case_labels, suites, suite_cases, feature_files, ci_targets,
run_requests.

## 4. Flaky Detection Semantics (rulings)

- **Confirmed (`same_commit`)**: the test passed and failed for one
  (commit, environment) across *different* runs — a duplicate inside one run
  is not a re-run.
- **Suspected (`flips`)**: outcome changes between consecutive executions,
  counted per branch; skipped excluded; errored↔failed is not a flip.
- Windows ≤90 d recombine exactly from `flaky_daily`
  (in-day flips + day-boundary transitions; pairs = per-branch runs−1);
  equivalence with the live scan is pinned by unit tests. Projects the
  rollup job has not visited fall back to the live scan.
- Measured (≈2M results): flaky 90 d 3.9 s from rollups vs 11.3 s live;
  14 d 0.83 s. Remaining 90 d cost is the failure-driven confirmed pass.

## 5. Gateway

NGINX: TLS (self-signed in dev), per-IP rate zones (`api` 20 r/s; `collect`
10 r/s on uploads; a stricter `auth` zone, 5 r/s, on login, register, password
reset/change, resend-verification, mfa/verify and sso), 10 MB bodies (the
Gherkin import route: `GATEWAY_IMPORT_MAX_BODY`, default 25 MB), gzip only on
the report and case-areas, JSON error pages, request IDs, regex routes sending
`/projects/{id}/(api-keys|runs|analytics|masking-patterns|export|notification-channels)`
to ingestion and `/projects/{id}/(cases|case-labels|case-folders|case-features|case-areas|features|suites|ci-target|run-requests)`
to test-management, SPA catch-all to the dashboard container with JSON 404
preserved for unrouted `/api/` paths; `/metrics` and `/internal` are never
proxied.

## 6. Dashboard (`dashboard/`)

React 19 + Vite + TypeScript, TanStack Query, Recharts (lazy chunks for
chart views). Access token in memory; session restored at boot via the
httpOnly cookie; 401s refresh once (auth/sso endpoints excluded). Views:
login (password/MFA step/SSO buttons when VITE_* client ids are baked),
register, verify email, forgot/reset password, org→project picker,
organization (members, invitations) and invitation accept, overview, trends
(day/week/month), tests, history, flaky (quarantine, CSV export), branches
(pick-two pass-rate comparison), runs (list + detail incl. changed files and
failures by cause; new runs by polling every 30 s, ADR-021), run compare,
requested runs, report, test cases (Scenario and Feature views, editor,
Gherkin import, Feature page), suites, project settings (API keys, CI
snippet, repositories, masking, notifications, Run from QEOS, legal hold,
export), account security (TOTP enrollment, password change), Ctrl K command
palette.
Design tokens with light/dark modes; WCAG AA contrast; status never
color-alone (PRODUCT.md commitments).

## 7. Collector (`collector/`)

`qeos-collector upload`: JUnit XML (pytest, Surefire incl.
flaky/rerun attempt expansion, Playwright, cucumber-js), Cucumber JSON,
Playwright JSON, TRX, NUnit 3, xUnit.net and TestNG; CI detection
(GitHub Actions/GitLab/Azure Pipelines/Jenkins), git code-change data
(GITHUB_BASE_REF / MR target / commit parent; never blocks an upload),
retry-safe idempotency keys, multi-part past 20k results / 9 MB, 2-minute
retry budget, `--spool` keeps failed parts for the next run, `--gate`,
`--component`, verified TLS (`--ca-file` pins a private CA). Also
`qeos-collector check` and `import-features`. Shipped as a GitHub Action
(`collector-action/`), a Jenkins library (`collector-jenkins/`), GitLab and
Azure templates (`templates/`), and per release tag a zipapp and a GHCR image.

## 8. Verification

- Per-service pytest suites + shared tests, collector (Python 3.9/3.12),
  dashboard Vitest (Testing Library + MSW) + tsc + eslint + build.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): service matrix, collector matrix,
  dashboard job, per-service container smoke, gateway full-stack smoke
  (`scripts/smoke_gateway.sh`, 70+ checks), CodeQL.
- `scripts/analytics_benchmark.py`: seeded ~2M-result benchmark;
  `scripts/bench_report.py` times every report section; results recorded in
  platforms/ingestion-service/README.md.
- Workflow: direct pushes to master, full relevant suites green before every
  push; TDD (tests watched failing first) for behavior changes.

## 9. Explicitly Not Built (see blueprint triggers)

Event bus/Kafka, CDC, data lake/warehouse, knowledge graph, vector store,
Redis, MinIO, Elasticsearch, Kubernetes/service mesh/Vault/GitOps, QIP
services, SDKs, mobile, AI features. Monitoring stack (Prometheus,
Alertmanager, Grafana as an opt-in compose profile): in progress, plan
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-10-monitoring.md`. `execution/`, `automation/`, `marketplace/`,
`collaboration/`, `intelligence/`, `platforms/qip-service` are unwired
prototypes excluded from compose/CI/gateway.
