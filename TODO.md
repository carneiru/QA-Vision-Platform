## In Progress / Next Steps

### Phase 2: Organization Service (delivered; reconciled 2026-10-04)
29. [x] Design organization and team management data models — organizations, organization_members (roles), organization_invitations
30. [x] Implement organization CRUD operations (soft delete included)
31. [~] Membership and roles done (owner/admin/member/viewer/billing_manager, last-owner protection); sub-teams inside an organization not built — no consumer yet
32. [x] Implement role-based access control (RBAC) within organizations — require_org_role, grant policy (admins cannot grant/remove owners)
33. [x] Develop invitation system for team members — single-use tokens, atomic claim, preview, dashboard accept page
34. [x] Create API endpoints for organization and team management
35. [x] Implement multi-tenancy data isolation — database per service; every project/ingestion read checks organization membership via /members/me
36. [x] Write comprehensive test suite (101 tests)
37. [x] Create API documentation — OpenAPI + platforms/organization-service/README.md
38. [x] Add Docker support — root compose, migration job
39. [x] Integrate with Auth Service for authentication and authorization — shared JWT, internal user lookup (single + batch)

### Phase 3: Project Service
40. [x] Design project management data models
41. [x] Implement project creation, updating, archiving
42. [ ] Create member and permission management within projects *(deferred: access follows organization roles; see the project-service design spec)*
43. [ ] Implement project categorization and tagging system *(not started)*
44. [ ] Develop project templates and cloning functionality *(not started)*
45. [x] Create API endpoints for project management
46. [x] Implement integration with Organization service for access control
47. [x] Write comprehensive test suite
48. [x] Create API documentation
49. [x] Add Docker support
50. [x] Integrate with Auth and Organization services
50.1. [x] Release the DB session before outbound HTTP calls (members/me, provider verification) so slow upstreams cannot exhaust the connection pool — read-only transactions end (rollback) before org-service members/me and before the repository provider call; the same defect fixed in ingestion's run detail (access check via project-service). Tests assert no open transaction at the moment of each HTTP call
50.2. [x] Map only uniqueness violations to 409 in project_service._commit; re-raise other IntegrityErrors — SQLSTATE 23505 on PostgreSQL (verified live: duplicate name → 409), SQLite message in tests; NOT NULL and other failures now surface as themselves

### API Gateway and full stack
- [x] NGINX gateway: routing, per-IP rate limits, self-signed TLS, JSON errors, request ids, JSON access log
- [x] Repository-root docker-compose: one Postgres, db-init, per-service migration jobs, shared SECRET_KEY
- [x] CI: full-stack smoke test through the gateway

### Gateway follow-ups
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards (Prometheus/Grafana) — *Phase 1, "Basic monitoring stack"*
- [x] Single-VM production deployment package — `deploy/` (ADR-019): Caddy TLS edge with Let's Encrypt as the only published service, gateway real-IP rate limits trusting only Caddy's fixed address, restart policies, `init-env.sh` strong secrets, daily `backup.sh` with restore verified, installation guide. Waiting on a VM + domain
- [ ] Kubernetes ingress; real certificates — *Phase 1 infra, when a cluster exists*
- [x] Service-to-service auth so organization-service can check users in auth-service — auth-service gained `GET /internal/v1/users/{id}` (HTTP Basic, same INTERNAL_API_PASSWORD pattern as project-service's retention API); the superuser `AUTH_SERVICE_TOKEN` is gone from config, compose and docs
- [ ] Shared rate limits in Redis — *when more than one gateway instance runs*
- [ ] JWT validation and per-user limits at the gateway — *when the gateway should reject bad tokens itself*
- [ ] API docs through the gateway — *when a frontend or partner needs browsable docs*
- [ ] WebSockets / SSE — *Phase 3, real-time features*. Deferred by ADR-021: new runs reach the dashboard by polling every 30 s; push starts (SSE first, Redis fan-out) when the collector streams partial results

### Ingestion (Phase 2, step 1)
- [x] ingestion-service: project API keys, POST /collect/runs (validation, idempotency, truncation), run read API, Prometheus metrics
- [x] In the root stack and behind the gateway; smoke-tested end to end

### Ingestion follow-ups
- [x] Collector agent MVP (JUnit XML parser, uploader with retry) — `collector/`, see below
- [ ] Queue-based processing for 1000+ events/second — *Phase 2 exit criterion*
- [x] PII detection and redaction; retention policies — masking on ingest, `ingestion-retention` job
- [~] mTLS between agent and platform — collector side done (`--client-cert`/`--client-key`); server-side enforcement (nginx ssl_verify_client) is a deployment decision
- [ ] Artifacts (screenshots, videos, traces, logs)
- [x] Per-test history endpoints — analytics `tests/{test_key}/history`, dashboard History view
- [x] Revoke a project's API keys when the project is deleted — done by the retention job
- [x] Re-mask results stored before masking existed — `python -m src.ingestion.jobs.remask [--dry-run] [--project ID]`: id-ordered committed batches, JSON summary, idempotent; text lengthened past 64 KB is cut back and flagged. Pilot data (9,853 results) checked: nothing to change
- [x] Custom masking patterns per project — project Settings → Masking: up to 20 RE2 patterns (linear time, no ReDoS; ADR-020), refused with a reason when invalid or matching empty text, named markers `[REDACTED:customer_id]`, a preview showing the sample exactly as it would be stored; applied at ingest and by the re-mask command, never across projects
- [x] Legal hold and data export before deletion. In Settings → Data, owners and admins can place
  or release a legal hold. The hold is stored in project-service columns with who, when and why.
  The retention list reports it, and the retention job deletes nothing of a held project; an
  answer without the field stops the pass. The same card downloads an NDJSON export of every
  run and result, streamed from ingestion and masked as stored. Verified live: the dry run
  reports `projects_held: 1`, and the export runs through the gateway.

### Collector agent (Phase 2, step 2)
- [x] `qav-collector upload`: JUnit XML (pytest, Surefire, Playwright, cucumber-js), one run per CI job
- [x] GitHub Actions, GitLab CI and Jenkins detection; retry-safe Idempotency-Keys; parts past 20,000 results / 9 MB
- [x] Retries with backoff and a 2-minute budget; HTTPS and verified TLS; the key never printed
- [x] CI: tests on Python 3.9 and 3.12; end-to-end upload through the gateway in the smoke test
- [x] Tag `collector-v0.1.0` — release workflow builds+verifies on the tag
- [x] Dogfooding: this repository's CI reports its own results (four service suites, dashboard, collector on 3.9/3.12) through the collector built from the same commit; enabled by the QAV_URL repository variable + QAV_API_KEY secret, push and same-repo PRs only, never fails the build
- [ ] Phase 2 exit criteria: agents on 3 CI platforms in real projects; 10k test executions ingested

### Collector — nice to have
Distribution
- [~] Publish to PyPI: workflow ready (trusted publishing, gated on repo variable PYPI_PUBLISH=true); needs the one-off publisher config on pypi.org (project qav-collector, repo carneiru/QA-Vision-Platform, workflow release-collector.yml, environment pypi)
- [x] Ready-made GitHub Action (`uses: carneiru/QA-Vision-Platform/collector-action@collector-v0.1.0`) and GitLab CI template (`templates/qav-collector.gitlab-ci.yml`) — both install the collector pinned to the tag
- [x] A Jenkins shared-library step — `collector-jenkins/vars/qavCollectorUpload.groovy` (workspace venv install, PEP 668-safe; key via env only). Proven against a real Jenkins LTS in Docker: library loaded from a git repo via JCasC, pipeline build SUCCESS, run stored with ci_provider=jenkins and the build URL
- [x] Azure DevOps (collector 0.2.0). The collector detects Azure Pipelines (`TF_BUILD`):
  commit, branch (the source branch on PRs), PR number (the visible number for GitHub-hosted
  code), target branch and build URL (project names percent-encoded). A job retry is a new
  run.
  - Ingestion accepts `ci_provider=azure_pipelines` (migration 011).
  - Repositories accept Azure DevOps URLs (`dev.azure.com`, legacy `visualstudio.com`, SSH v3,
    and `org@` clone URLs), stored as owner `org/project`, project-service migration 003. They
    are verified through the anonymous REST API; a private project's 401/203 reads as
    "not found or private".
  - Step template `templates/qav-collector.azure-pipelines.yml` and an Azure Pipelines CI
    snippet in Settings.
  - Verified live: an upload with an Azure PR environment was stored with every field, and a
    real public Azure repository was verified.
- [x] A Docker image and a single-file (zipapp) build for runners without pip — zipapp (`collector/scripts/build_zipapp.py`, stdlib-only, runs on any Python 3.9+) and `collector/Dockerfile` (python:3.12-slim + git). On every `collector-v*` tag the release workflow uploads sdist+wheel+pyz to a GitHub Release and pushes `ghcr.io/carneiru/qav-collector:<version>` + `:latest` (user-approved public surfaces, 2026-10-03)

Formats
- [x] Cucumber JSON (classic formatter) — scenarios map to the existing result shape (suite=feature, class=uri; background folds in; failed step fails, undefined/pending skip). Rich tags/steps columns still need ingestion fields — deferred until a consumer exists
- [x] Playwright JSON — own reporter format; retries kept as per-attempt results, projectName as suite, timedOut→failed, interrupted→errored. Attachments wait for artifact ingestion (below)
- [x] TestNG XML, NUnit 3 XML, xUnit.net v2 XML, .NET TRX — dispatched on the XML root element (`formats.py`); same result shape, formats mix freely in one upload

Richer data
- [x] Keep each retry attempt as its own result, so flaky tests become visible — Surefire flakyFailure/flakyError/rerunFailure/rerunError expand into per-attempt results (duplicate testcases, pytest-rerunfailures style, already passed through)
- [x] Git metadata: commit author and message (git log -1, best effort), PR number + base branch (GitHub/GitLab env), stored per run and shown on run detail
- [x] Code-change data, not just JUnit: changed files and diff stats per run — collector gitdiff module, ingestion migration 005 + run API, dashboard Changes card. Correlation analytics remain Phase 6 input.
- [x] Components under test: `--component NAME@SHA` (or `QAV_COMPONENTS`) records which repo versions the run exercised (e.g. the product build an E2E suite ran against) — ingestion migration 008 + run API, "Under test" line on run detail. Dormant Phase 6 input; cross-repo correlation and Workspaces stay behind their triggers (ADR-018).
- [x] Test ownership from CODEOWNERS — collector matches each result's `file` (git semantics, last line wins; root/.github/docs locations), ingestion stores `owner` per result (migration 009), run detail shows it
- [ ] Artifact upload (screenshots, videos, traces) — blocked behind the blueprint's MinIO adoption trigger (artifact storage); starts when the artifacts feature is pulled, not before

Reliability and operations
- [x] Keep a failed upload on disk and retry it later — automatic via `--spool` (below); a separate `retry` command adds nothing, the next upload resends first
- [ ] Stream partial results during long runs — needs a long-running watch mode (the collector currently runs after the tests finish; multi-part uploads already flow sequentially). Revisit if a real pipeline shows the need
- [x] `qav-collector check`: verifies URL shape, TLS trust, API key (GET /collect/key names the project) and report parsing, without uploading; exits 2 on the first failure
- [x] Keep-and-retry failed uploads: `--spool DIR` / `QAV_SPOOL` stores undelivered parts (base64 JSON, capped at 100) and the next invocation resends them under their original Idempotency-Key; non-retryable rejections (401/409/4xx/TLS) are dropped, not respooled
- [x] A `.qav.yml` config file — flat keys + string lists, built-in reader (zero dependencies kept for the zipapp); precedence flags > env > file; API key never accepted in the file
- [x] Client certificates (mTLS) — `--client-cert`/`--client-key` (`QAV_CLIENT_CERT`/`QAV_CLIENT_KEY`) load into the TLS context; server-side enforcement is a deployment concern (nginx `ssl_verify_client`), not in the local stack

### Microsoft SSO
- [x] Sign in with Microsoft (Entra ID) ID tokens from an allowlist of tenants; link to an existing account
- [x] Signing-key fetch hardened for Google and Microsoft (timeout, throttled refresh); outages answer 503
- [ ] Personal Microsoft accounts (outlook.com)
- [ ] Map Entra groups / app roles to organization roles
- [ ] SCIM provisioning and deprovisioning
- [ ] GitHub SSO
- [ ] Single sign-out
- [x] MFA for password accounts: TOTP enrollment (QR + otpauth URI), verification on login, recovery codes; SSO sign-ins defer MFA to the identity provider
- [ ] SAML 2.0 sign-in for enterprise IdPs that don't do OIDC (SP-initiated, signed assertions, per-organization IdP metadata); complements the existing Google/Microsoft ID-token flows

### Analytics API (Phase 3, step 1)
- [x] Daily trends in a requested time zone; per-test list, history; flaky detection (same commit + environment, flip rate)
- [x] Summary tables: flaky_daily rollups + analytics-rollup job; window raised to 90 days (90d: 3.9 s from rollups vs 11.3 s live; 14d: 0.8 s)
- [x] Weekly and monthly views — trends bucket=day|week|month (Monday weeks, local calendar), dashboard View select, window up to 365 days
- [x] Branch comparison — per-branch aggregates endpoint + Branches tab with two-branch pass-rate chart
- [x] Mute / acknowledge a flaky test — muted_tests table, mute/unmute endpoints, dashboard controls
- [x] CSV export — client-side, tests and flaky views (see Dashboard follow-ups)
- [x] Dashboard UI — login, project picker, trends, tests, history, flaky (`dashboard/`)

### Dashboard follow-ups
- [x] SSO sign-in buttons (Google, Microsoft) in the login page — rendered only when `VITE_*` client ids are baked at build time; manual verification against a real tenant still pending
- [x] Refresh token in an httpOnly cookie — `qav_refresh`, Secure, SameSite=Strict, Path=/api/v1/auth (ADR-013)
- [x] Mute / acknowledge flaky tests
- [x] CSV export buttons on the tests and flaky views (client-side; tests view pages the API at limit=200, capped at 10k rows)
- [x] Branch comparison — per-branch aggregates endpoint + Branches tab with two-branch pass-rate chart
- [x] Organization management UI — `/organizations/:orgId` (members list/remove, invite by email+role, pending invitations with revoke; controls gated on owner/admin via `GET /members/me`; the invite link with the single-use token is shown once, from the 201) and `/invitations/:token` accept page closing the self-service loop; Manage link per organization in the picker. Audit follow-ups landed: member rows carry emails (auth batch internal lookup, best effort), the accept page previews organization+role via authenticated `GET /invitations/{token}` (dead token = unknown token), per-row accessible action names, copy button on the invite link

- [x] Registration in the UI — /register page (full name optional, "check your email" state says where the link lands when SMTP is unconfigured), /verify-email SPA landing that verifies and signs the person in (the emailed link now points there instead of the raw API endpoint), Create account link on the login page
- [x] Dashboard redesign (2026-10-04, user decisions: sidebar navigation, overview as the project entry, nothing sacred) — design tokens (spacing scale, radius, two-step shadows, accent-text/accent-fill/danger-text with every text pair computed >= 4.5:1 in both themes), app shell with a sidebar (project switcher grouped by organization, project views with icons, workspace and account sections) that becomes an accessible drawer under 900px, an Overview page answering 'what is broken now' (latest run verdict in words, its failures, this week's pass rate and the flaky count, as the API computed them; a guided empty state), and a Projects page listing every organization's projects at once. Verified rendered: desktop light and dark, 390px, zero horizontal scroll
- [x] Keyboard and screen-reader navigation — skip link + <main> landmark (WCAG 2.4.1), per-view document titles e.g. "Runs · Shop E2E · QA Vision" (2.4.2), focus moves to the new view's content on navigation (not on load or redirects). Destructive actions (revoke API key, remove member, revoke invitation) confirm in place: the confirm button takes focus, Escape/Cancel return it to the trigger
- [x] Error banner text in dark mode was 3.6:1 — new --danger-text token (#d03b3b light 4.6:1, #ec7272 dark 6.0:1); charts and status dots keep the validated status hue
- [x] CI wiring snippets in project Settings — ready-to-paste GitHub Action / GitLab include / Jenkins step / plain CLI, with this deployment's origin filled in and the key always referenced as a CI secret. Decision 2026-10-03: ingestion stays push-based; a "connect repository" (GitHub App, webhooks, artifact pull) would still require the repo's CI to produce JUnit XML, adds third-party credential custody, and locks to one forge — deferred to the Phase 4/6 slice below
- [x] Quality report (roadmap Phase 3, step 5). The project's **Report** view covers the last
  7/30/90 days: a summary (runs, executions, pass rate without skipped tests, failures), a
  weekly table, the most failing and slowest tests, flaky tests and branches. It is built on
  the existing analytics API, with tables rather than charts, so it reads and prints well.
  - **Save as PDF** prints through a print stylesheet: no app chrome, no page breaks inside rows.
  - **Download CSV** gives the per-test data behind the report.
  - Scheduled delivery (TODO 66) is done: the weekly summary below.
- [x] Weekly summary (TODO 66). Any notification channel (email, Slack, Teams, webhook) can get
  last ISO week's numbers every Monday from 07:00 UTC, alongside failed-run alerts or instead of
  them. It covers runs, executions, pass rate against the week before, failures, the five
  most-failing tests and a link to the Report.
  - A quiet week says "no runs", so a pipeline that stopped uploading is noticed.
  - The `weekly-summary` job sends once per channel per week (`last_weekly_week`, advisory lock).
  - "Send summary" in Settings sends it on demand.
  - Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-05-weekly-summary-design.md`. Verified against Mailpit:
    one email with the right numbers, and no resend after a restart.
- [x] Live runs (roadmap Phase 3, step 7, by polling: ADR-021). The first page of **Runs** and
  the **Overview** refresh every 30 s while the tab is visible. New runs get a short tint and a
  polite "N new runs" announcement; later pages never move under the reader. A new latest run
  also refreshes the Overview's weekly pass rate and flaky count.
- [x] Run filters and search (roadmap Phase 3, step 8). The **Runs** view filters by status
  (with failures / all green) and branch, and **More filters** adds environment, CI, commit
  prefix, pull request, author and a date range. Filters live in the URL, so a filtered view
  can be shared and survives back/forward. The Tests view already had name search.
  "From/to" are whole days in the viewer's time zone; the API takes instants.
- [x] Repositories in project Settings — attach the repository the tests live in by pasting a browser or clone URL (optional default branch, otherwise the provider's), status in words (Reachable / Not found or private / Not checked) with Check again, remove with an in-place confirm; viewers and billing managers read only. Rendered at 1280px and 375px
- [x] CI snippet on a localhost deployment — the CLI leads by default with the self-signed certificate step, and choosing GitHub or GitLab shows that their hosted runners cannot reach localhost (CLI, self-hosted runner with --ca-file, or a public deployment)
- [ ] GitHub App integration ("connect repository") — justified when cross-repo correlation starts (Phase 6 consumes product-repo commits via API; run_components/ADR-018 already capture the link). Scope then: app registration, webhook ingestion of commits/PRs for connected product repos, optional run discovery. Not an ingestion replacement
- [x] Create flows in the UI — "New organization" (slug derived from the name, editable, backend pattern enforced) and "New project" (owner/admin only) in the picker; Settings tab per project with API-key management (create shows the full key once with a copy button, list shows prefix/created/last-used, revoke; revoked keys lose the action). Closes the last curl-only step: a team can go from register to first upload entirely in the browser

## Next Version (v2) — Backlog

Not scheduled. These move QA Vision from *observing* test runs (the roadmap's scope: a
collector reports results from the customer's own CI) to also *authoring and running*
them. Items marked *(suggested)* were added during review as natural companions to the
requested ones. Each group needs its own design spec before implementation.

### A. Test case management
- [x] Friendly UI to browse, create and edit test cases (TCs): **Test cases** view (list, filters, editor with ordered steps, read-only for viewers)
- [x] Create/add labels on TCs; filter and search by label
- [x] Create suites — static (hand-picked TCs), ordered, edited in place
- [x] Link a TC to the automated test that implements it; the case shows that test's latest result
- [ ] Dynamic suites defined by a label query, e.g. `smoke AND checkout` *(suggested)*
- [ ] TC versioning: who changed what, and when *(suggested)*
- [x] Import existing TCs from the repo (Gherkin `.feature` files, JUnit XML) *(suggested)* (Gherkin done 2026-10-06, ADR-023; JUnit still open)
- [x] qav-collector import-features: CI keeps cases in sync; API-key access to test-management; refuse a full import that would archive over half the imported cases without --allow-mass-archive (2026-10-06, ADR-024)
- [x] Dashboard 'complete features folder' option (full=true): archives cases of missing files, keeps renamed files' numbers; the confirm button names the archive count (2026-10-06)
- [x] Case filters: folder dropdown with the tree, feature, Azure DevOps item, link and latest-result filters on All Cases (`/cases/search`, `/case-folders`, `/case-features`, `latest-keys`), the searchable `FilterSelect`, gateway route and smoke checks (2026-10-06)
- [x] Last runs column: run-strip endpoint, RunStrip component with one-link design and shape cues, Cases column with skeleton and error states, legend, DESIGN.md and TODO docs (2026-10-06)
- [ ] Bound latest-keys (window over full history) — time-bound or DISTINCT ON when projects get large (suggested)
- [ ] Link TCs to requirements/tickets (Azure DevOps, Jira) *(suggested)*
- [ ] Bulk actions: label, move, archive many TCs at once *(suggested)*

### B. Test execution
- [ ] Run a single TC, a selection ("bunch"), or a whole suite
- [ ] Re-run only the failures from a previous run
- [ ] First version triggers the customer's CI (GitHub Actions `workflow_dispatch`) rather than running tests on QA Vision's own infrastructure *(suggested — far smaller security surface than executing customer code)*
- [ ] Live run progress and cancel a running job (see `specs/2026-07-13-qa-vision-realtime-features.md`) *(suggested)*
- [ ] Run parameters: target environment, browser/device matrix *(suggested)*
- [ ] Scheduled runs (nightly, per branch) *(suggested)*
- [x] Flaky-test quarantine. Quarantining a test (Flaky view, the former Mute) keeps it running and
  shown, but its failures stop counting:
  - a run failing only in quarantine reads "Passed · N quarantined";
  - failure alerts skip such runs, and otherwise mention "N quarantined, not counted";
  - the upload receipt carries `quarantined`/`blocking`, and `qav-collector upload --gate` exits 1
    on failures outside quarantine (and fails closed when the upload did not happen).
  The run page and the failure groups mark quarantined tests. An auto-retry policy stays with the
  test runner (Playwright `retries`, pytest-rerunfailures); the platform already keeps every attempt.

### C. Results, history and evidence
- [ ] TC run history (pass/fail/duration over time) — already planned in roadmap Phases 2–3
- [ ] View screenshots and screen recordings attached to a run
- [ ] Playwright trace viewer and step-by-step logs per failed TC *(suggested)*
- [x] Compare two runs side by side. `/projects/{id}/runs/{run}/compare/{base}` sorts each test
  into new failures, fixed, still failing, slower, added and removed. The run page links to a
  comparison with the previous run on its branch, and any run number can be typed in instead.
- [x] Causes over time: each cause on the run page shows whether it is new in this run, how many
  runs in a row it has failed (since #N), and how often it appeared in the last 20 runs of the
  branch. The Overview marks new causes.
- [x] Group failures by error signature, so one broken locator shows as one problem, not forty. The first error line, with numbers, ids and hashes ignored (`analytics/signature.py`), groups a run's failures: `GET /api/v1/runs/{id}/failure-groups`; the run page shows **Failures by cause**, the Overview lists causes instead of tests
- [ ] Shareable link to a failed run *(suggested)*
- [x] Failure notifications to Slack/Teams/email. Slack, Microsoft Teams (Workflows webhook,
  Adaptive Card), generic https webhooks and email (one to five addresses) are done. Channels live in Settings → Notifications:
  - per-branch filter, a test button, and the last delivery shown in words;
  - delivery is a background task after the upload, one attempt, outcome recorded;
  - an SSRF guard (vendor hosts, public addresses only, checked again at send time, no
    redirects), and URLs are never returned.

  Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-05-failure-notifications-design.md`. Email goes through
  `qav_shared.mail`, shared with auth. Compose now passes `SMTP_*` to auth and ingestion: before,
  the documented SMTP settings reached no container. Verified with a local Mailpit sink: the
  verification email, a test message and a failed-run message were all delivered. Roadmap
  Phase 3, step 4.

### D. AI prompt chat
- [ ] Create TCs from a prompt
- [ ] Fix failing TCs from a prompt
- [ ] Every AI change is delivered as a pull request or a reviewable diff, never committed directly *(suggested — keeps a human in the loop)*
- [ ] Explain a failure from its logs and screenshots *(suggested)*
- [ ] Turn manual TC steps into an automated test *(suggested)*
- [ ] Ask questions about test data in plain language ("which tests failed most this week?") — roadmap Phase 6 *(suggested)*
- Note: the roadmap defers "natural language test generation" past year one because predictive ML needs months of collected data. An assistant built on a hosted LLM does not depend on that data, so this group can be scheduled independently of Phase 6.

### E. Repository configuration and secrets
- [ ] Edit configuration files (`*.json`) — restricted to a configured config path only
- [ ] Validate edits against a JSON schema and show a diff before saving; save as a PR *(suggested)*
- [ ] Manage the repo's environment variables (the GitHub `.env`)
- [ ] Store them as GitHub Actions secrets/variables through the GitHub API rather than committing a `.env` file; values write-only and masked in the UI *(suggested — a committed `.env` leaks its secrets to everyone with read access)*
- [ ] Per-environment profiles (dev / staging / prod) *(suggested)*
- [ ] Audit log of every config and secret change *(suggested)*

### F. UX
- [ ] Onboarding wizard: connect a repository, install the collector, first run *(suggested)*
- [ ] Global search across TCs, suites and runs *(suggested)*
- [ ] Personal dashboard: my suites, my recent failures *(suggested)*

### G. Built-in terminal
A terminal in the browser (xterm.js over a WebSocket). An interactive shell is remote code
execution by design, so this ships in three levels, each its own spec, and each level only
after the one before it is proven:
- [ ] **Level 1 — live output console (read-only):** stream a run's stdout/stderr as it happens, with ANSI colours, search, and download. No input. Low risk; reuses the run/job infrastructure from group B
- [ ] **Level 2 — command console (allow-listed):** a terminal-style prompt that only accepts platform commands (`run suite smoke`, `rerun failed`, `git status`, `show config`), each mapped to an API call and bound by the same per-action permissions as the UI. No arbitrary shell
- [ ] **Level 3 — full interactive shell:** a real PTY inside an ephemeral, per-user sandbox container (repo checked out, test toolchain installed), destroyed at session end. Requires: container isolation (gVisor/Firecracker class, no host mounts, no Docker socket), egress restrictions, CPU/memory/time limits, idle timeout, no platform secrets inside the sandbox, session recording to the audit log, and an explicit per-organization opt-in
- Note: Level 3 means running customer code on QA Vision's own infrastructure — the exact surface group B's `workflow_dispatch` approach avoids. Build it only if Levels 1–2 leave a real gap.

### H. Platform prerequisites for v2
These are not features, but groups B, C, D, E and G cannot ship without them:
- [ ] Frontend application (React/TypeScript, per the roadmap tech stack)
- [ ] GitHub App integration — scoped repo access, workflow dispatch, secrets API — instead of personal access tokens
- [ ] Artifact storage for screenshots, videos and traces (S3-compatible; MinIO for local development)
- [ ] Job queue for runs and AI requests (Redis is already in the stack)
- [ ] Secrets management (Vault or cloud equivalent) — brought forward from "prepare for" to required
- [ ] Permissions per action: who may run tests, edit config, manage secrets, accept AI changes

## Completed Documentation (Reference)
All architectural specifications and design documents from the initial brainstorming phase have been completed and serve as the foundation for implementation phases.

## Current Status
**Phase 1 (Authentication Service) is complete and ready for use.** The service provides:
- Secure user authentication with email/password
- JWT-based session management with refresh token rotation
- Foundational SSO capabilities (Google implemented, framework ready for others)
- Password reset and change (links are logged when SMTP is not configured)
- Comprehensive user management with role-based access
- Full test coverage and API documentation
- Dockerized deployment ready

**Ready to begin Phase 2: Organization Service** which will build upon the Authentication service to provide multi-tenant organization and team management capabilities.
