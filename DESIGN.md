# Design System: QEOS

## Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Triage Desk"**

QEOS is an internal Operate surface. People open it after a red build or in a weekly review, and every visual decision serves one question: what is broken, what is flaky, what is getting worse. The system is restrained on purpose. Cool blue-grey slate neutrals carry the structure, one cyan accent marks interaction and location, and the four validated status hues are kept for test outcomes only. Since nothing else on screen is saturated, a red dot means a failure.

Density is moderate. The body text is 14px with an 8px-based spacing scale. Cards, tables and tiles sit on a quiet page tone, a top bar carries the brand, a breadcrumb (with the project switcher) and the user menu, and a slim icon rail on the left holds every view. Light and dark are both first-class and follow the OS (`prefers-color-scheme`). There is no manual toggle. Every text pair is computed against its actual background in both themes and clears WCAG AA (4.5:1). Where a hue fails that test, the system adds a separate text token rather than accepting the miss.

Depth is light and ambient: hairline borders do the structural work, and a faint shadow lifts cards off the page. Motion is short and functional (120ms colour/border transitions, a 120ms rail reveal, a 120ms command palette fade, a 200ms drawer slide) and switches off under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Cyan Slate: cool blue-grey slate neutrals, one cyan accent, status hues reserved for status.
- Every readable text pair is at least 4.5:1 in both themes. Each accent and danger hue has a separate role token for text and for fill.
- Status is never colour alone. A word or label always sits beside the hue.
- Top bar + icon rail shell. The rail expands over the content on hover or focus and can be pinned open; at 640px and below it becomes a focus-managed drawer.
- Icons come only from lucide-react, marked `aria-hidden`, and always sit beside visible text or inside an `aria-label`ed control.
- Touch targets are 44px under `pointer: coarse`. Body text grows to 16px under 640px.

## Colors

The palette (Cyan Slate, chosen 2026-10-08 after Midnight Indigo was rejected for its violet) is a cool blue-grey slate neutral with one interaction cyan, plus a colour-blind-validated status set that never decorates. Dark-theme counterparts carry the `-dark` suffix in the frontmatter. Status hues, `accent-fill` and `on-fill` are the same in both themes.

### Primary
- **Signal Cyan** (`accent`): focus rings, the active nav icon, the brand mark, project-tile hover border; non-text only in light (3.7:1 on white), `#22d3ee` in dark (9.6:1 on Paper). Text selection uses Button Cyan.
- **Link Cyan** (`accent-text`): all links and any accent text (5.4:1 on white, 4.7:1 on Sidebar Mist; the dark value `#67e8f9` is 12:1 on Paper).
- **Button Cyan** (`accent-fill`, hover `accent-fill-hover`): the fill of primary buttons and of text selection. White on it measures 5.4:1 (hover 7.3:1). The same value is kept in dark mode so white text stays legible.
- **Cyan Wash** (`accent-soft`): a translucent tint of the accent for soft selected states.

### Status (reserved)
- **Passed Green** (`status-passed`), **Failed Red** (`status-failed`), **Errored Orange** (`status-errored`), **Skipped Stone** (`status-skipped`): the validated status palette from PRODUCT.md. Use them for status dots, chart series of outcomes and badge icons. A status colour is always followed by its word or a label naming it, and never stands alone as a shape: dots, badges and chart bars also differ by shape or texture (see Status Dot and Badges, Chart Textures). Errored Orange is `#c4501f` in light (4.65:1 on Paper, 4.32:1 on Mist Page) and `#ec835a` in dark (6.59:1 on Paper). Every status colour reaches 3:1 on Paper in both themes; `lib/contrast.test.ts` checks it.
- **Danger Text** (`danger-text`): error copy, the error banner border and text, and the failed badge label. It exists because the dot red is a chart/dot hue, not a text colour. It measures 4.6:1 on the banner's red tint in light and 6.0:1 in dark.
- **Passed Text** (`passed-text`) and **Errored Text** (`errored-text`): the readable text of the passed/ready and errored status pills, beside Danger Text for failed. Light `#15803d` is 5.02:1 on Paper (4.54 on a hovered row) and `#b2461a` 5.55:1 (5.02 hovered); dark `#4ade80` is 9.98:1 and `#ec835a` 6.59:1 on Paper. They exist for the same reason as Danger Text: the status hues are for marks, not words.
- **Danger Fill** (`status-failed`, hover `danger-fill-hover`): the confirm button of a destructive action. White on it measures 4.8:1 in both themes, while red *text* on the dark surface would fail AA.

### Chart Series
- **Series Cyan** (`series-1`) and **Series Ember** (`series-2`): the two lines of a comparison chart, such as branch A against branch B. They are for non-status series only.

### Neutral
- **Mist Page** (`page`; slate `#0b1117` in dark): the app background. Code blocks also use it to sit one step below the card surface.
- **Paper** (`surface-1`; `#121b24` in dark): cards, inputs, buttons, tiles, badges and the active nav item.
- **Sidebar Mist** (`surface-2`): recessed panels (secret blocks). Its dark value is also the chrome in dark mode.
- **Chrome** (`chrome`): an alias, not a new colour. The top bar, the rail and the drawer use it: Paper in light, Sidebar Mist in dark.
- **Ink** (`text-primary`): headings, body and values.
- **Graphite** (`text-secondary`): all readable secondary text, including labels, metadata, table headers, `.muted` copy and inactive nav (6.8:1 light, 6.7:1 dark).
- **Tick Grey** (`text-muted`): chart axis ticks only. It is below AA for text (about 3.7:1) and must never carry readable copy.
- **Rule** (`grid`): table row dividers and list separators.
- **Header Band** (`thead`): the background of a data table's header row. An alias of Sidebar Mist in light; in dark `#0f1820`, a step lighter than Sidebar Mist and just under Paper. Graphite on it is 5.91:1 (light) and 6.95:1 (dark).
- **Hairline** (`border`) and **Hairline Strong** (`border-strong`): translucent borders for containers and for buttons.
- **Control Edge** (`control-border`): the border of inputs, selects, textareas and checkboxes, at least 3:1 against every surface they sit on (WCAG 1.4.11). Light `#71879a`: 3.73 on Paper, 3.46 on Mist Page, 3.24 on Sidebar Mist. Dark `#5f7488`: 3.59 on Paper, 3.79 on Sidebar Mist, 3.92 on Mist Page. Used for form controls only, so the rest of the interface stays light.
- **Placeholder** (`placeholder`): placeholder text at full opacity, at least 4.5:1 (light `#56687a`: 5.74 on Paper, 5.00 on Sidebar Mist; dark `#93a3b5`: 6.74 on Paper).
- **Hover** (`hover`) and **Hover Strong** (`hover-strong`): translucent washes for row hover and button/nav hover; Hover Strong is cyan-tinted and also fills label tags.

### Named Rules
**The Reserved Hue Rule.** Green, red, orange and skipped-stone mean test outcomes. They never decorate, brand or highlight anything else. The only non-status uses are destructive confirmation (red fill) and error messaging (danger text), and both mean "something failed or will be destroyed".

**The Never Alone Rule.** A status colour is never the only signal. Every dot, badge and series carries its word ("12 failed", "Passed") or a legend.

**The Computed Pair Rule.** No text/background pair ships without being computed at 4.5:1 or better in both themes. When a hue fails, add a role token (`-text`, `-fill`) instead of using the hue anyway.

## Typography

**Display Font:** none (the product has no display role)
**Body Font:** Inter (variable, self-hosted via `@fontsource-variable/inter`), falling back to the system UI stack
**Label/Mono Font:** ui-monospace stack (ui-monospace, "SF Mono", "Cascadia Mono", Consolas, monospace)

**Character:** A single sans family across every role, separated by weight (500 to 650) and small size steps rather than by contrasting faces. Mono marks machine text such as commit SHAs, failure messages and CI snippets.

### Hierarchy
- **Headline** (650, 22px, 1.25, -0.01em): the one page heading, which is the project name or view name.
- **Title** (600, 17px, 1.3): card and section headings.
- **Title Small** (600, 15px, 1.35): sub-section headings.
- **Stat** (650, 28px, tabular figures, -0.01em): the single headline number in an overview card. The tile value is a 26px sibling.
- **Body** (400, 14px, 1.5): everything else. It rises to 16px under 640px, because iOS zooms into inputs below 16px and phones read better at that size.
- **Label** (500, 13px): form labels, metadata rows and tile labels, in Graphite.
- **Label Small** (600, 12.5px): badges and filter chips.
- **Table Header** (600, 11px, uppercase, 0.05em tracking): data table headers, in Graphite on the Header Band.
- **Pill** (600, 11px): status pill words.
- **Mono** (12.5px, or 0.92em inline): failure messages, SHAs and code blocks.

### Named Rules
**The Tabular Numbers Rule.** Tables, tiles and stat figures use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` so columns of counts and rates align.

**The 16px Phone Rule.** Body text is 14px on desktop and 16px at 640px and below. Do not set input text below the body size.

## Layout

An app shell runs the full height of the viewport: a 48px sticky top bar across the full width, a 56px icon rail on the left (220px when pinned open) and a fluid main column, all on Chrome. The page scrolls under the top bar, and `scroll-padding-top` keeps a focused control clear of it. Content sits in a centred page container (max 1120px) with 32px/24px padding, reduced to 24px/16px under 640px. Single-card focus pages (sign in, register, verify) narrow to 400px with 48px top padding.

Spacing follows a 4px-based scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48). Cards own their vertical rhythm through 16px block margins, which collapse between siblings so conditional stacks stay evenly spaced. Inside a grid, the grid gap owns the spacing and card margins are zeroed.

Grids are auto-fitting rather than column-counted:
- **Overview grid:** `auto-fit, minmax(260px, 1fr)` with a 16px gap. A *wide* card spans the full row; the latest run gets this.
- **Tiles:** `auto-fit, minmax(170px, 1fr)` with a 12px gap.
- **Project grid:** `auto-fill, minmax(220px, 1fr)` with a 12px gap.

Breakpoints:
- **1280px and up:** a new visitor gets the rail pinned open; below, it starts collapsed. The reader's choice (pin toggle) is remembered in localStorage.
- **640px and below:** the rail becomes an off-canvas drawer (min(85vw, 300px)) behind the top bar's menu button; a 40% black backdrop closes it. The breadcrumb moves to a second line of the top bar. Body text goes to 16px and page and card padding tighten.
- **641px and up:** a list's table header sticks under the top bar while its table fits its card (see Data Tables).
- **`pointer: coarse`:** inputs, selects, buttons, filter chips, rail links and menu items grow to a 44px minimum height, and table cells to 12px padding, without changing density on mouse devices.

### Named Rules
**The Grid Gap Owns It Rule.** Inside a grid, children carry no margins. Outside one, a card's own block margin sets the rhythm.

**The Coarse Pointer Rule.** Every interactive control reaches 44px under `pointer: coarse`.

## Elevation & Depth

The system is a hybrid that leans flat. Hairline borders carry structure, and two ambient shadow levels exist. Shadows never signal status and are never hard-edged or offset.

### Shadow Vocabulary
- **Resting lift** (`box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(17,17,16,0.04), 0 1px 3px rgba(17,17,16,0.06)`; dark: `0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.4)`): cards and project tiles.
- **Overlay** (`box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(17,17,16,0.12), 0 2px 6px rgba(17,17,16,0.08)`; dark: `0 12px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.5), 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.4)`): elements that float over content, namely the rail while it expands over the page, the user menu, the open drawer, the command palette and the focused skip link.

### Named Rules
**The Two Levels Rule.** Resting surfaces get the resting lift and floating layers get the overlay. There is no third level, and hover does not raise elevation. Hover changes border colour or background tint instead.

## Shapes

Corners are gently rounded and come in two sizes. Controls (buttons, inputs, nav links, code blocks, the error banner, the skip link) use 6px. Containers (cards, project tiles) use 10px. Badges are full pills (999px) and status dots are 8px circles. Borders are 1px translucent hairlines, never heavier. The focus ring is a 2px accent outline offset 2px (offset 0 on text fields).

## Components

### Buttons
Quiet by default. Only one action in a group is filled.
- **Shape:** gently rounded (6px), 34px minimum height (44px on coarse pointers), 6px 10px padding, weight 500, with 6px between icon and label.
- **Default:** Paper fill, Ink text, Hairline Strong border. Hover applies the Hover Strong wash.
- **Primary:** Button Blue fill with white text and no visible border. Hover goes to the deeper fill. There is one primary per form or action group.
- **Danger:** Failed Red fill with white text. It appears only as the confirm step of an in-place destructive confirmation, never as a first-click trigger.
- **Ghost:** transparent fill and border. Used for icon-only controls (menu, close, the rail's pin toggle).
- **Disabled:** 55% opacity with a default cursor.
- **Motion:** 120ms ease-out on background and border colour, removed under reduced motion.

### Destructive Confirmation (signature)
A destructive action never runs on the first click. The trigger is a default button. Clicking it swaps in place for a group with three parts: a one-sentence consequence ("what stops working"), a Danger confirm button that takes focus, and a default Cancel. Cancel or Escape backs out and returns focus to the trigger. There is no modal.

### Status Dot and Badges
- **Status dot:** a 10px mark in the status hue with a shape of its own: circle for passed, triangle for failed, square for errored, ring for skipped. It is `aria-hidden` and always followed by its word or count label ("3 failed").
- **Run verdict badge** (`RunStatusBadge`): icon and word, *Passed*, *Failed* or *Errored* (failures first, then errors). Overview and any run summary use this component; `note` appends text ("Passed · 2 quarantined"). The runs list shows the same verdict (`runVerdict`) as a Status Pill (`RunVerdictPill`).
- **Badge:** a Paper pill with a Hairline border, 12.5px/600, holding a 14px lucide icon and a word. *Passed* has Ink text with a green icon. *Failed* has Danger Text and a border at 40% of the failed red. Badges are for summaries (the Overview verdict, notification delivery); table rows use the Status Pill.
- **Status pill** (`StatusPill`): the status inside a table row. A small pill (11px/600, 1px 7px padding, 999px radius) with no fill, its word in the tone's readable text token and a Hairline at 45% of the status hue, plus a 12px lucide icon whose shape differs per tone, so the word and the shape carry it without the colour (Never Alone). Tones: *passed* (circled check, Passed Text), *ready* (plain check, Passed Text: a ready case is not a test result), *failed* (circled cross, Danger Text), *errored* (triangle, Errored Text), *running* (loader, not spinning, Link Cyan), *queued* (clock) and *cancelled* (slash) in Graphite, and *neutral* (Graphite, Hairline Strong, no icon) for a draft or archived case. Used for case status (`CaseStatusPill`), run verdicts in the runs list (`RunVerdictPill`) and requested-run status. A requested run's pill holds only the status word ("Running", "Cancelled", "Didn't start"); the rest of its line ("1 test · started by ana", the error) follows it in the cell.

### Run Strip
A compact visual history of a test across recent runs, as a minimum 24px-tall link to the newest run. The strip holds one 6×18px bar per run with a 2px gap, oldest on the left.

- **Link:** the only keyboard-focusable element, its accessible name reads "Last 10 runs: 7 passed, 2 failed, 1 re-run, opens run #435". The summary counts every status, including "not run". It goes to the newest run the test was in (the last non-null status). Bars are `aria-hidden`.
- **Bars** are non-interactive spans with hover tooltips. Colours signal the last attempt's outcome in that run:
  - **Passed:** `--status-passed` (green).
  - **Failed:** `--status-failed` (red) with a notch cut from the top to signal failure without colour alone.
  - **Re-run:** `--status-rerun` (amber: #b07800 light, #e0a000 dark) with diagonal stripes to distinguish it without relying on hue (dark stripe tone #8a6200, 3.2:1 on the surface).
  - **Skipped:** a dashed outline with no fill, since the test did not run.
  - **Not in run:** a solid hairline outline in `--text-muted` (3.6:1 light, 4.9:1 dark) with no fill.
  - Each bar colour meets at least 3:1 non-text contrast against the cell's background in both themes.
- **WCAG:** the notch, stripes and outlines satisfy 1.4.1 (use of colour); the single 24px-tall link satisfies 2.5.8 (target size).
- **Accessibility:** a visually-hidden ordered list of all runs and their statuses follows the link (screen readers announce "Last 10 runs: 7 passed, 2 failed, 1 re-run" then list each bar's details). When the test is in none of the runs, the strip has `role="img"` with the summary only. With zero runs in the project, the cell shows the muted text "No runs yet".
- **Rendering:** until data arrives, the column shows 10 outlined skeleton bars (`--surface-2` fill, `--border-strong` outline). If the request fails, a dash appears and the rest of the page continues working.
- **Column placement:** "Last runs" goes after Title as `hide-narrow`, hidden at 640px and below. A legend above the table explains the colours and shapes. It is hidden when no case on the page is linked. An unlinked case shows only the text "not linked", with no empty strip.

### Run from QEOS
Starting a GitHub Actions run from the cases, and watching it end.

- **Play:** a Primary button with the Play icon ("Run", "Run selected (n)", "Run suite"). When disabled, the reason sits beside it in Graphite text, linked when Settings can fix it.
- **Confirmation:** an inline, non-modal card with `role="dialog"` that lists up to 10 cases then "+n more", `repo @ branch`, and the amber `.warn-note` "Tests may create real bookings in staging". For a suite with manual cases the title reads "Run n automated cases (m manual cases skipped)?" and lists only the automated ones. Focus goes to Cancel, Escape backs out, and Run reads "Starting…" and ignores a second click.
- **Selection bar:** sticky at the bottom of the list, with checkboxes on imported rows for editors only. A 200-case cap disables the remaining boxes. The select-all box is indeterminate while only some of the page is selected.
- **Run panel:** a card with `role="status"`. It has one state line with an 18px lucide icon whose shape differs per state (clock, spinning loader, check, cross, slash, alert), with colours from tokens, so state never rests on colour alone. The spin stops under reduced motion. It has "View in GitHub". Stop uses the Destructive Confirmation pattern ("Stop this run?" then "Stop run"), then "Stopping…", then "Stopped by <name>". When a run ends while Stop is answered, the panel quietly shows the final state. The results line appears only for a run that completed on GitHub: "Waiting for results…", or a link to the results, or after 5 minutes "Results not received: check the QEOS upload step". A completed run whose conclusion is skipped reads "Skipped" with the slash icon and the Stone tone, since it did not run. When the server holds an `error` for the request, the panel shows it: under the state line as a muted line on an active request ("GitHub: token invalid or expired"), and in the state text of a cancelled row ("Cancelled: The run is no longer on GitHub"). The Requested runs tab shows the same line under the status. The elapsed time on a running request is `aria-hidden`, and a visually hidden line states the status and changes only when the status does, so a screen reader is not interrupted every second. An ended run stays for 60 minutes after it ended (the later of `stopped_at` and `checked_at`), however long it ran. The panel re-reads the clock every 30 s, so that message appears without any other update, and not at all while there is no request.
- **Token expiry:** the amber `.warn-note` for owners and admins, from 14 days before expiry, inside a `role="status"` region that is always present so a change is announced. An expired token reads "Expired on <date>" in the Settings connection line, never "Connected".
- **Requested runs:** a tab beside Runs (route `runs/requested`) listing every Play with who requested it, the case count, the status, who stopped it, and links to GitHub and to the results.

### Cards / Containers
- **Corner Style:** 10px.
- **Background:** Paper on the Mist Page.
- **Shadow Strategy:** resting lift (see Elevation & Depth).
- **Border:** 1px Hairline.
- **Internal Padding:** 24px, or 16px under 640px and inside tile grids.
- **Anatomy:** an optional head row (title left, badge or action right), body, and a foot pinned to the bottom (`margin-top: auto`) that holds the one-click "go deeper" link.
- A card that holds a data table scrolls horizontally inside itself. A list's table card (`sticky-head`) is measured (`useIsWide`: a ResizeObserver on the card and its table, `scrollWidth > clientWidth`); while its table fits, the card opens up so the header can stick to the page, and a table wider than its card keeps its scroll (`is-wide`) with a plain header. No clipping, no nested scroll box.

### Sortable Headers
`SortableTh` puts a button inside the `th`. The `th` carries `aria-sort` (`ascending`, `descending`, or `none`; absent state is `none`), and the button shows an arrow: a double chevron when idle, an up or down arrow on the sorted column. Clicking the sorted column flips it; another column starts descending for figures and dates, ascending for names. The sort lives in the URL as `sort` and `dir` (`lib/sort.ts`, defaults left out), so reload, share and Back keep it. Sorting happens on the server when the API has a sort parameter for that column (Tests: failures, duration, name), otherwise on the rows already loaded, and the page says so ("Sorted within these 50 rows"). Missing values always sort last.

### Narrow Meta
Columns that phones drop (`hide-narrow`) come back as a muted second line in the row's first cell (`NarrowMeta`: label in 600 weight, then the value). It is `display: none` above 640px, so a value is never read twice. Use it on every table that hides columns: Runs (status first), Tests, Flaky, Branches, Compare, Report, Requested runs, the import plan and Cases. Where a column is a graphic (the Cases run strip) the line carries a count instead ("1 failed, 2 passed of the last 3").

### Chart Textures
Outcome series are never told apart by hue alone. `ChartPatternDefs` defines the fills once per page: passed is solid, failed is diagonal stripes, errored is dots, skipped is thin lines, drawn in the surface colour over the status colour. The chart bars and the legend swatches point at the same ids. Comparison lines differ by dash (the second line is dashed) and carry point markers.

Each chart is a `figure` with an off-screen caption that states the totals and the notable point, uses Recharts' `accessibilityLayer` (arrow keys step through the tooltip) and has no `role="img"`. Below it a native `details` (`DataTableDisclosure`, "Show data table") holds the full series as a table. The legend (`SeriesLegend`) is a row of toggle buttons (`aria-pressed`): a hidden series is struck through. Titles, captions, column headings and the last-value tile name the granularity (day, week, month); X ticks are short `Intl` dates ("Mar 4"), thinned on narrow screens; tick text is Graphite, not Tick Grey.

### Secret Block
A value the server shows once (API key, invitation link, recovery codes) sits in a `SecretBlock`: Sidebar Mist fill, Hairline Strong border, a bold one-line note saying it cannot be shown again, the value in mono (wraps anywhere), and a Copy button whose result ("Copied") is announced politely. Recovery codes add Download and an "I saved these codes" button that dismisses them; the codes are not hidden until the reader says so.

### Data Tables
Dense by default. Rows are separated by Rule hairlines, with no zebra striping and no vertical lines; hovering a row applies the Hover wash.

- **Header:** the Table Header style (11px/600 uppercase, 0.05em tracking, Graphite) on the Header Band, never wrapping. Above 640px, on a list whose table fits its card, it is sticky at `top: 48px`, just under the top bar, inside the page scroll (a wide table keeps its sideways scroll and a plain header instead). The page's `scroll-padding-top` covers the top bar plus a sortable header row (`--thead-height`, 41px: 48 + 41 + 8 = 97px), so a row reached by keyboard never lands under either (WCAG 2.4.11). A sorted column keeps its `SortableTh` arrow.
- **Rows:** cells use 8px 12px padding and are top-aligned; every body row is at least 40px tall, room for a 24px control (row checkbox, run strip, row link) with 8px around it. Checkboxes, sort buttons and row links keep 24px targets.
- **Numbers** (`.num`, on the `th` and its `td`s): counts, durations and rates are right-aligned with tabular figures. Words (Priority: low, medium, high) stay left-aligned. A sortable number header puts its arrow on the left, so the label lines up with the figures.
- **Status:** a Status Pill, never bare text.
- Phones keep the existing behaviour: the run strip column and `NarrowMeta` are unchanged.
- **Case titles** (`.case-title`) are the row's primary text at 14.5px/500 in Ink, Link Cyan and underlined on hover or focus. The weight is 500, not 600: the title leads by size and colour, so a long list does not read as a wall of bold.

### Cases: Group by Feature or Scenario
The Cases list has two views of the same filters, chosen by **Group by** (a segmented pair of buttons in the filter bar, `role="group"` named by its visible "Group by" label, each button `aria-pressed`) and stored in the URL as `group=scenario` (Feature, the default, writes nothing). A pressed segment takes the Signal Cyan edge, Link Cyan text on the Cyan Wash and 600 weight, so the state does not rest on colour; under `pointer: coarse` the segments are 44px tall. Switching keeps the filters and goes back to page 1; Apply and Clear all keep the grouping.

- **Scenario view** is the case table as it was.
- **Feature view** is one table with the Scenario view's columns plus **Scenarios**: Title, Scenarios, Last runs, Priority, Status, Automated. Each `.feature` file is a row (`GET /features`, 50 a page): a 24px chevron disclosure (`aria-expanded`, named "Show scenarios of Login"; 44px on coarse pointers), the feature name at 500 linking to the Feature page, its folder in Muted text under it, the scenario count in Scenarios (a feature-only column, right-aligned, tabular), and under Last runs the same run strip as a scenario row (same bars, link and aria summary), and only the strip: no failing count. The strip is one status per run, the worst over the feature's scenarios (failed, then re-run, passed, skipped, not run); `GET /features` sends each row's `test_keys` (distinct automated keys, at most 200), the page fetches every row's strips together in chunks of 200 keys and merges them. A feature with no linked scenario says a muted "not linked" (an older server's row leaves the cell empty); on phones the meta line gives the same count summary as a scenario row. The run legend shows in Feature view whenever a row on the page has keys, expanded or not. A file with no Feature name is titled by its file name without the `.feature` extension (here and on the Feature page); its path keeps the extension. Priority, Status and Automated on a feature row aggregate the scenarios that match the filters (computed by `GET /features`, or from the cases when the page groups them itself): Priority is the highest priority as plain text (labelled "Highest priority: high"); Status is one pill when every scenario shares a status, otherwise the counts as muted text without pills ("2 ready · 1 draft", ordered ready, draft, archived, only statuses that have scenarios); Automated is "All linked" with the Bot icon and `.linked` class, a muted "Manual" when none is linked, or "3 of 5 linked". A value the server did not send leaves its cell empty. On phones Priority and Automated join the row's narrow meta line; Status stays in its column. The manual cases form one last row, "No feature (manual)", which has no link and no checkbox (nothing to run). Expanding a row adds its scenarios as rows of the same table (a `tbody` named "Scenarios of Login") on a Sidebar Mist band, titles indented to line up under the feature name and the Scenarios cell empty, so every column lines up with the feature above. A file's scenarios come from its detail in file order, kept to the row's filtered case numbers, and the manual group's from `/cases` with the same filters.
- **Failing count:** the failed latest-result keys (the request the Failing tile shares) resolved to case numbers in one `/cases/search` of at most 200; a row counts its case numbers in that set. When more than 200 cases fail, rows show no count rather than a partial one.
- **Filters the feature list cannot apply** (Latest result, Origin, Feature, Azure DevOps, Archived) make the Feature view group the matching cases itself, from one read of up to 200; past that a status line says so and offers the Scenario view.
- **Selection:** a feature row's checkbox selects every runnable scenario it holds and is tri-state (`indeterminate` while only some are picked); "Run selected" works the same in both views.
- **Search in:** a select beside Search (Feature, Scenario, Both), stored as `search_in` only when chosen; otherwise it follows the view (Feature in Feature view, Scenario in Scenario view). The placeholder names what is searched. A chosen scope shows in the search chip ("Search (both): pay"). The Ctrl K palette is unchanged.

### Feature Page
`/projects/:id/cases/feature?path=…`: the feature name as the `h1` (the file name until it loads) and the path as the subtitle, with Run feature (Play for every scenario of the file, editors only) as the one primary. The raw file, as last imported, is a numbered Gherkin block: line numbers in Muted text drawn from `data-line` (never read out or copied), long lines wrapping under their own text. Each scenario's heading line ends with a mono link chip ("TC-12", 24px tall, Link Cyan on Paper with a Hairline Strong edge) and the case's run strip, or "not linked". A file imported before raw files were stored shows the scenarios rebuilt from the cases' Gherkin (a case without Gherkin by its title) under an info note: "Re-import this file to see it exactly as written." Cases whose heading is not found in the file are listed under it.

### Filter Chips
A row (`FilterChips`, a `group` named "Quick filters") between a list's filter form and its table. The full form stays as it was; the chips are a shortcut onto the same URL state, never a new server filter.

- **Quick chips:** toggle buttons (`aria-pressed`) in a 999px pill, 28px tall, 12.5px/500: Graphite on Paper with a Hairline Strong edge. Pressed, a chip takes a Signal Cyan edge, Link Cyan text on the Cyan Wash layered over Paper (4.76:1 light, 9.43:1 dark) and a 12px tick, so the state does not rest on colour. Chips that set the same URL key are one choice: pressing Ready while Draft is on switches the value, and pressing the pressed chip clears it. Cases: Failing (`result=failed`), Never ran (`result=never`), Linked (`linked=true`), Manual (`linked=false`), Draft, Ready (`status`). Runs: Failed (`status=failing`), Passed (`status=passing`), main (`branch=main`). Flaky has no quick chips: "Show quarantined" stays the one control for including quarantined tests, and the API has no reason filter for "Suspected". Tests has no outcome filter, so it has no quick chips either.
- **Applied chips:** every other filter in force, including thresholds away from their default, is a chip reading "Name: value" ("Label: flights", "Folder: features / hotels", "Search: legroom") with a 24px remove button named "Remove filter Label: flights". A value a pressed quick chip already shows is not repeated. The row is always mounted (empty, taking no room, when there is nothing to show).
- **+ Filter:** a dashed chip, on pages whose secondary filters sit in a disclosure (Cases, Runs). It opens the disclosure and moves focus to its first control.
- **Clear all:** a ghost button in Link Cyan at the end of the row, shown while any filter is applied; it keeps the sort. It is the list's only clear control (the forms have no "Clear filters" of their own).
- **Focus:** removing a chip moves focus to the chip that takes its place, else the one before it, else the row (`tabIndex=-1`); Clear all moves it to the row. Focus never drops to the page body.
- **Disclosure:** a filter a pressed quick chip shows does not open the Filters disclosure (it would show twice); a filter only the form shows still opens it, even on phones. The summary still counts every filter inside. Runs' "More filters" is controlled: removing its last chip leaves it open.
- **Drafts:** the form follows the URL only in the fields the URL changed, so pressing a chip keeps Search text typed but not yet applied. Clear all is the exception: it blanks the whole form (defaults for thresholds), unapplied drafts included.
- **Announcing:** on Runs a filter change is announced in the existing status line once its runs arrive ("12 runs", "50+ runs"); new runs arriving take precedence. The other lists have no results-count region, so none is added.
- **Behaviour:** chips write the URL (a history entry each, so Back and Forward step through them) and reset paging. The row wraps on narrow screens; Tab moves through the chips and Space or Enter toggles one. Under `pointer: coarse` chips are 44px tall.

### Inputs / Fields
- **Style:** Paper fill, Hairline Strong border, 6px radius, 34px height (44px on coarse pointers). Labels stack above the field at 13px/500 in Graphite.
- **Hover:** the border darkens to Tick Grey.
- **Focus:** the border turns Signal Cyan, with a 2px accent outline at offset 0.
- **Filter dropdown:** a filter dropdown with more than 15 options is a searchable list (`FilterSelect`): a search field at the top of the open list, matching anywhere and ignoring accents, with an "x of y" count. Up to 15 options stay a native select.
- **Folder dropdown:** the folder filter (`FolderSelect`) looks like the other filters; its popup is a dialog with a search box, an "x of y" count and the folder tree. Searching keeps matching folders and their ancestors, Enter picks the first match, Esc and Tab close it, and picking applies at once.
- **Text field** (`TextField`): label, input, hint and error as one block. The error appears under the field when it is left (not while typing), is linked with `aria-describedby`, sets `aria-invalid`, and is never inside the `<label>`. A password field has a Show/Hide toggle (an eye icon with off-screen text, `aria-pressed`) outside the label. Checkboxes are drawn 18px (24px when they are a row's only target, in a table cell) with the Control Edge border; a label around one is the hit area.
- **Public pages** (`AuthShell`): the QEOS name and subtitle are a lockup paragraph; each page has its own h1 ("Sign in", "Create account", "Reset your password").
- **One primary:** each view has one primary button. A dirty form's Save takes it from Run; Run on a selection takes it from New case; Import takes it from Preview once there is a plan.
- **Inline form:** a one-row create form of label and input pairs ending in its submit and Cancel buttons. It wraps on narrow widths.

### Navigation
- **Top bar:** 48px, Chrome with a bottom hairline, sticky. In order: the brand (lucide mark in Signal Cyan with the bold 15px wordmark, a link to the project picker), the breadcrumb, a spacer, the search trigger (see Command Palette) and the user menu.
- **Breadcrumb:** `<nav aria-label="Breadcrumb">` with an `<ol>`: Org (link to the organization) / Project / section (on detail pages, e.g. Runs) / Page. The project item *is* the project switcher, a compact native select grouped by organization, labelled "Project". The last item is the page, Ink at 600 with `aria-current="page"`; the others are Graphite links. Slashes are CSS decoration with empty alt text. The org crumb holds a placeholder until it is known so the trail does not shift, and it is hidden from 641 to 900px so the bar never overflows.
- **User menu:** a 32px round avatar (the email's initials, Link Cyan on Cyan Wash) that discloses a popup (Paper, overlay shadow, 10px radius): the email, then a plain list of Security and Organization links and, below a hairline, Sign out. It is a disclosure (`aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, normal Tab order), not an ARIA menu, because its items are navigation. Escape closes it and returns focus to the avatar; a click or focus outside, or following an item, closes it. Sign out clears the query cache, so the next account in the tab never sees the previous one's data.
- **Icon rail:** 56px of Chrome with a right hairline. Project views (Overview, Runs, Tests, Flaky, Branches, Trends, Report, Test cases, Settings), then a hairline, then the workspace items (All projects, Organization). Each item is a 40px-tall target with an 18px lucide icon and a visually hidden label; the item on screen has `aria-current="page"`, a Cyan Wash fill, a Link Cyan icon and a 3px Signal Cyan bar on its inline-start edge. Hover (after a 200ms rest) or keyboard focus inside (not the focus a mouse click leaves behind) expands it to 220px *over* the content with the overlay shadow: the rail's box switches width at once (it overflows its grid track, so nothing moves) while the sheet behind it slides in with a 120ms transform and the labels fade in; no layout property is animated, and nothing animates under reduced motion. While collapsed, each label shows as a tooltip (Ink chip, Paper text) on hover or focus; Escape hides tooltips until the pointer or focus moves again. On viewports under 600px tall the collapsed rail scrolls with 32px items, and its tooltips switch to fixed positioning so the scroll box does not clip them. The pin toggle at the bottom ("Expand sidebar" / "Collapse sidebar", `aria-pressed`) keeps it open at 220px, pushing the content. Below 1024px wide a stored pin is ignored (but kept for wider screens).
- **Mobile (640px and below):** the top bar adds a ghost menu button before the brand and wraps the breadcrumb to a second line. The rail becomes the drawer, which slides in over 200ms `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)` with labels visible and a close button. Opening it focuses the first link. Escape, the backdrop, the close button or following a link closes it; focus returns to the menu button, except after a link, when it goes to the new page's heading.

- **Menus never underline.** Rail and drawer links, breadcrumb links, user-menu items and view tabs (Cases/Suites, Runs/Requested runs) have no underline at rest or on hover; the hover tint and the active background are the affordance. Underlines are kept only for inline links in body text (WCAG 1.4.1). One explicit rule in `index.css` covers all of these and outranks the in-sentence link rule.

### Command Palette
Global search and jump-to, in the top bar and on the keyboard. It is **the one sanctioned modal** in QEOS: a command palette is the standard pattern for "go anywhere from anywhere", and it holds nothing that could be lost. Every other confirmation and form stays in place (see Destructive Confirmation).

- **Trigger:** between the breadcrumb and the avatar, a 32px field-shaped button on Mist Page with a Hairline Strong edge: a search icon, "Search cases, runs, tests…" in Graphite, and a `kbd` hint ("Ctrl K", or "⌘K" on Apple platforms). It carries `aria-haspopup="dialog"` and `aria-keyshortcuts`. On phones it is a ghost icon button named "Search". Ctrl K / ⌘K opens it from anywhere, and "/" opens it when focus is not in a field (also when the layout types "/" with AltGr). A key another handler already took (`defaultPrevented`) or one typed mid-composition (IME) is left alone.
- **Dialog:** `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, named "Search", 640px wide (the viewport less 16px each side), 12vh from the top (16px on phones), Paper with the overlay shadow over a scrim of the page tone at 78% (`color-mix` of `--page`), so it reads in both themes. It is portalled to `<body>`; while it is open every other child of `<body>` is `inert` and the page does not scroll, and both are undone on close. The search field is its only Tab stop: Tab stays on it. Esc (wherever focus is) or a press on the scrim closes it, and focus returns to where it was when the palette opened (the trigger when nothing held focus). Opening a result moves focus to the new page's heading instead.
- **Combobox:** the field is a WAI-ARIA combobox (`aria-controls`, `aria-autocomplete="list"`, `aria-activedescendant`) over a listbox of groups (`role="group"` named by its visible uppercase label). Arrow Down and Up move the active option (wrapping), Home and End jump to the first and last, Enter opens it, and the pointer moves the active option on hover. The active option takes the Hover Strong wash with a 2px Signal Cyan inline-start bar. Options are at least 40px tall (44px on coarse pointers).
- **Sources:** Recent (the last 5 opened, newest first, in `localStorage` under the signed-in user's id; signing out forgets every list; blocked storage just means none) and Pages (the project's views and the workspace pages, matched on name from the first letter) need no request. From two characters, and 200ms after the last keystroke, Test cases (title, Gherkin text and the case key: "TC-12", "tc12" or "12" finds case 12 first; the key and title show), Tests (name, over the Tests view's 30 days), Suites (name contains, opening the suite; the server returns them by name and the palette keeps 5) and Runs are asked in parallel, 5 each; a superseded request is aborted. "#433" or "433" reads run 433's summary (header and counts, no results) and leads the list as "Run #433" with its branch and failed count when it exists (a 404 or 403 just means no run); other text matches runs whose branch contains it, in any case (`branch_contains`). Projects come from the lists the project switcher loads. Outside a project only Pages and Projects are offered, and Recent keeps only workspace items and the current project's.
- **States:** the matched text is a `mark` (Cyan Wash, Ink, weight 600). A source that fails shows one Danger Text line in its own group ("Couldn't search tests right now"), skipped by the arrows; the other groups carry on. With nothing found the dialog says `No matches for "…"`. A visually hidden polite status announces "5 results" or the no-match sentence once every source has answered.
- **Motion:** a 120ms fade and settle (scale from 0.98) on open; nothing under reduced motion.

### KPI Tiles
A row of summary tiles under a list's page header, above its quick filters. Cases has four: Cases (the total, with "N imported"), Pass rate (this week, as Overview's card), Failing (linked cases whose latest result is failed, the Failing chip's join counted) and Flaky (the Flaky view's default 14-day count, with the quarantined count).

- **Shape:** a Paper card (10px radius, Hairline, resting lift) with 12px 16px padding: an uppercase 11px/600 Graphite title, the value at 24px/650 in tabular figures, and a 12.5px sub-line. A 14px lucide mark before the title says the tone, by shape and colour: a dotted circle in Signal Cyan for neutral, a check circle in Passed Green for good, an alert circle in Failed Red for bad. There is no coloured side edge (a thick side stripe reads as generated UI and as a status bar). Pass rate is good when up or flat and bad when down; Failing is bad above zero; the rest are neutral.
- **Never colour alone:** the pass-rate sub-line always has a lucide arrow (up, down, or a dash for flat) *and* the word ("up 3.1 pts vs last week") in Passed Text or Danger Text; the arrow is an icon, not a Unicode glyph.
- **Grid:** 4 columns, 2 under 1024px, 1 under 360px.
- **Links:** a tile that leads somewhere is a link (Failing to `?result=failed`, which presses the Failing chip; Flaky to the Flaky view) with a Signal Cyan border on hover and no underline. Its name is the whole sentence ("Failing 17 linked cases whose latest result failed"). A tile that is not a link is a `group` named by the same kind of sentence ("Pass rate 92.4%, up 3.1 points versus last week").
- **Requests:** a tile reuses the query of the screen that owns the figure, under the same key, and keeps an answer for a minute: Pass rate and Flaky are Overview's queries (Flaky asks with quarantined tests included and each reader counts what it shows), the total is the list's folder total, and Failing is the list's own "Failing" join (latest failed keys, then the search the list sends with only Failing applied), so its number is that list's total and opening the tile costs no request.
- **States:** each tile loads (its own skeleton in a polite status), fails and retries on its own. A failed tile shows "—" and a Retry button ("Retry pass rate") and is not a link while it fails. A missing week is said, never shown as zero ("no runs this week").

### Page Header
Every signed-in page starts with `PageHeader`: the page name as the one `h1` (22px/650), an optional Graphite subtitle line under it, actions on the right (at most one primary, the rest secondary) and optional view tabs (Cases/Suites, Runs/Requested runs) underneath. Under 640px the actions wrap below the title. The org and project are not repeated: the breadcrumb carries them. Section headings inside a page are `h2`.

### Project Tile
A Paper tile with a 10px radius, Hairline border and resting lift, holding a folder icon and the project name at 600. On hover the border turns Signal Cyan, with no lift and no underline.

### Error Banner
A 6px-radius box with a Danger Text border and text over a 6% failed-red tint, with an optional Retry button. It uses `role="alert"`. Loading and empty states are plain Graphite sentences that say what is absent and how data arrives. They never show a zero in place of missing data.

### Code Block
Mist Page fill, Hairline border, 6px radius, 12px padding, 13px mono, and horizontal scroll. It is used for copyable CI snippets. An expanded failure message inside a table cell is mono 12.5px with preserved line breaks and no box. A read-only Gherkin block colours keywords, tags, tables, doc strings and comments, plus step values: quoted "values" use `--gk-string` and `<placeholders>` use `--gk-param` on a light tint of `--gk-param-bg`; each meets 4.5:1 on Sidebar Mist in both themes. A numbered block (a whole `.feature` file) wraps long lines instead of scrolling, with the line number in a 4ch gutter and any line annotation (a case chip) at the end of its line.

### Accessibility Plumbing
- A **skip link** stays hidden until focused, then appears top-left as a Paper chip with the overlay shadow.
- **Route focus:** on each user navigation (not the first render, not redirects), focus moves to the new page's `h1`. Lazily loaded views (Trends, Branches) render their PageHeader outside the Suspense boundary, so the h1 exists at once and keeps focus while the view loads. The skip link still targets the content region. Headings and regions take focus without a visible ring; the ring belongs to controls.
- **Titles:** each view sets `document.title` as "View · Project · QEOS".
- **Focus not obscured (top):** above 640px the page's `scroll-padding-top` covers the sticky top bar and a sticky sortable table header row.
- **Focus not obscured:** a bar stuck to the bottom of the viewport (the Cases selection bar) writes its height to the page's `scroll-padding-bottom` while it exists and pads the table, so a row reached by keyboard scrolls above it.
- **Landmarks:** the top bar is the `banner`, the rail is `nav` "Main", the breadcrumb is `nav` "Breadcrumb", and the page is `main`.
- **Command palette:** the one modal besides the phone drawer (see Command Palette): focus trapped on its field, Esc closes it and gives focus back.
- **Drawer:** on phones the open rail is a modal dialog (focus trapped, Escape from anywhere closes it). Following a link in it hands focus to the new page's heading, not back to the menu button. Widening the window past the breakpoint closes it and removes the dialog role.
- **Live regions:** a status card announces only its status line (`role="status"` on that line), never the links and buttons around it.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- **Do** use `accent-text` for links and blue text and `accent-fill` behind white text. Keep `accent` for rings, icons, selection and hover borders.
- **Do** use `text-secondary` for all readable secondary copy. Use `text-muted` only for chart axis ticks.
- **Do** pair every status hue with its word, count or legend.
- **Do** use `danger-text` for error copy and the failed-red fill only for the confirm step of a destructive action.
- **Do** take icons from lucide-react only, sized 14 to 20px and `aria-hidden="true"`, beside visible text or inside a control with an `aria-label`.
- **Do** give every interactive control a 44px minimum under `pointer: coarse` and keep 16px body text under 640px.
- **Do** compute any new text pair in both themes before shipping. It must be 4.5:1 or better.
- **Do** confirm destructive actions in place, with the consequence stated in one sentence and focus moved to the confirm button.
- **Do** give each view a `document.title` and move focus to its content on navigation.
- **Do** put the one-click "go deeper" link in a card's foot.

### Don't:
- **Don't** open a modal. Confirm in place and edit in the page. The command palette is the single sanctioned exception (and the phone drawer is the rail, not a dialog of its own).
- **Don't** use green, red, orange or skipped-stone for anything that is not a test outcome, error or destruction.
- **Don't** set body or link text in `accent` or `status-failed`, because neither reaches AA as text on every surface.
- **Don't** add a third shadow level, raise elevation on hover, or use hard offset shadows.
- **Don't** use icons from any other set, emoji or Unicode glyphs as icons, or an icon without a text label.
- **Don't** add a manual theme toggle or a light-only colour. Every token needs a dark counterpart or a reason it holds in both themes.
- **Don't** show zero, a placeholder number or sample data where the API returned nothing. Show the absence.
