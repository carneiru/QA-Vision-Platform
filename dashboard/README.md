# QEOS Dashboard

React + Vite + TypeScript SPA for the analytics API. Served as static files
by nginx behind the platform gateway (`location /`), so the app and the API
share one origin.

## Develop

    cd dashboard
    npm install
    npm run dev      # Vite dev server; /api/* proxied to https://localhost:8443

Run the stack first (`docker compose up -d --build --wait gateway`) so the
API answers.

## Test / check

    npm run test       # Vitest + Testing Library + MSW
    npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
    npm run lint       # eslint
    npm run build      # production build to dist/

## SSO buttons

Google and Microsoft sign-in render only when their client ids are baked at
build time (`VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `VITE_MSAL_CLIENT_ID`, optional
`VITE_MSAL_AUTHORITY`, default `organizations`). They must match the
auth-service configuration (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_ALLOWED_TENANTS`);
the compose file forwards them as build args. The SPA obtains an ID token
(Google Identity Services button / MSAL popup) and posts it to
`/api/v1/sso/{provider}`.

## Auth model

Access token in memory; the refresh token never reaches JavaScript — it lives
in the httpOnly `qeos_refresh` cookie (Secure, SameSite=Strict, scoped to
`/api/v1/auth`). App boot restores the session with one silent refresh. On
401 the client refreshes once and retries; a failed refresh returns to
/login. A 401 from the auth endpoints themselves (a failed login) is
surfaced as the API's own error detail.
