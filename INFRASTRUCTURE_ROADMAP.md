# Infrastructure Excellence Roadmap for QA AI Dashboard Platform

> **Status (2026-10-11): a target plan written in July 2026, not a description of what runs.**
> None of the `infra/` deliverables below exist. What is true today: services log to stdout
> (the gateway writes one JSON line per request) and every service serves Prometheus `/metrics`;
> the monitoring stack (Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana as an opt-in compose profile) is in
> progress (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-10-monitoring-design.md`). CI runs every test suite,
> container smoke tests and a full-stack gateway smoke (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`); CodeQL and
> Dependabot cover security scanning (2.2, in part); the gateway enforces per-IP rate limits (2.3,
> in part). No Loki, Jaeger, Istio, Vault, Kafka/schema registry, autoscaling, chaos tooling,
> feature flags, Hadolint or SBOMs. Production is one VM with Docker Compose behind Caddy
> (ADR-019); Kubernetes-based items wait on the blueprint's adoption triggers. Current state:
> README.md, TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md, the blueprint banner. The file's original text ended in

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to address all infrastructure gaps identified in the platform assessment, following industry best practices for cloud-native, enterprise-grade applications.

## Executive Summary

The QA AI Dashboard Platform (now QEOS) has microservices foundations with idempotent uploads and retrying clients, and basic observability (stdout logging, Prometheus `/metrics`; no tracing). However, to achieve production-grade excellence, the platform requires significant enhancements in infrastructure, observability, security, and automation domains.

This roadmap provides a prioritized, actionable plan to address all 18 identified gaps, organized by implementation phases with clear deliverables, success criteria, and estimated effort.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Observability (Weeks 1-4)

### 1.1 Centralized Logging & Metrics Backend
**Gap**: Only the gateway logs JSON (the services write plain text) and nothing ships logs to a central store; metrics are exposed but there are no Grafana dashboards or alerting rules yet.

**Solution**: 
- Deploy Loki/Promtail/Grafana (Loki stack) for log aggregation
- Enhance Prometheus deployment with recording rules and alerting
- Create standardized Grafana dashboards for service-level and business metrics
- Implement structured logging enrichment with trace IDs and service metadata

**Deliverables**:
- `infra/logging/loki-stack/` - Helm chart for Loki stack
- `infra/monitoring/prometheus/` - Enhanced Prometheus configuration
- `infra/monitoring/grafana/dashboards/` - Service and business dashboards
- `infra/logging/logging-standard.md` - Logging format guidelines
- Updated services to emit structured logs with trace context

**Success Criteria**:
- All service logs aggregated in Loki with <5s latency
- Grafana dashboards showing RED metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration) for all services
- Alerting rules configured for critical SLO violations
- Documentation on log format and querying

### 1.2 Distributed Tracing Enhancement
**Gap**: No distributed tracing (the July text assumed a basic Jaeger setup; none exists).

**Solution**:
- Ensure 100% trace propagation across all service boundaries
- Add custom spans for business logic operations
- Implement trace sampling strategies for cost control
- Add trace-based alerting for latency anomalies

**Success Criteria**:
- End-to-end tracing for all user journeys
- <1% trace loss rate
- Ability to trace requests from ingress to database

### 1.3 Service Mesh Foundation
**Gap**: No service mesh for mTLS, traffic management, observability.

**Solution**:
- Implement Istio service mesh in evaluation mode
