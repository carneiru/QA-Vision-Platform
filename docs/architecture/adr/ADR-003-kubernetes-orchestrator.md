# Context

## Business Problem
As the QEOS platform decomposed into numerous microservices across domains, we required a robust platform to deploy, scale, and manage these services reliably. Manual deployment was error-prone, did not scale, and lacked the resilience and automation needed for production workloads.

## Technical Problem
Managing containerized services at scale introduced challenges in service discovery, load balancing, rolling updates, self-healing, resource optimization, and consistent cross-environment deployment. We needed a platform that abstracts infrastructure complexity while delivering enterprise-grade orchestration.

## Architectural Drivers
- Automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized services
- High availability and fault tolerance
- Declarative configuration and infrastructure as code
- Service discovery, load balancing, and traffic management
- Reliable rollout and rollback capabilities
- Resource isolation and quota enforcement
- Portability across multi-cloud and hybrid environments

## Constraints
- Compatibility with existing container images and registries
- Integration with current monitoring, logging, and security tooling
- Adherence to enterprise security and compliance standards
- Team familiarity with container technologies
- Budget and licensing considerations for enterprise platforms

## Assumptions
- Organization will invest in Kubernetes expertise and tooling
- Operations team has sufficient maturity to manage Kubernetes clusters
- Existing CI/CD pipelines can be adapted for Kubernetes
- Network and storage infrastructure can support Kubernetes workloads

## Quality Attributes Involved
- Reliability
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Portability
- Security
- Operational excellence

# Decision
Select Kubernetes as the container orchestration platform for the QEOS platform to provide automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized services across all domains.

## Scope
All containerized services within QEOS, including domain services, infrastructure services, and platform components packaged as containers.

## Affected Domains
All domains: Platform, Execution, Quality Intelligence Platform (QIP), Automation, Collaboration, Administration, Marketplace, and Integrations

## Implementation Boundaries
- Services are packaged as Docker images
- Desired state defined via Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.)
- Helm charts package complex applications for repeatable deployment
- Kubernetes namespaces provide logical isolation for environments and teams
- Ingress controllers expose services externally
- Persistent volumes support stateful workloads
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) governs access to cluster resources

# Alternatives Considered

## Docker Swarm
### Pros
- Simpler installation and operation
- Native Docker integration
- Built-in load balancing and service discovery
- Familiar to Docker-centric teams
- Lower resource overhead for small footprints

### Cons
- Fewer features than Kubernetes
- Smaller ecosystem and community
- Limited advanced scheduling and customization
- Fewer enterprise-grade security and governance capabilities
- Declining industry adoption
- Constrained multi-cloud and hybrid cloud support

### Decision
Not selected

### Reason
Docker Swarm lacks the advanced capabilities, ecosystem breadth, and enterprise readiness required for QEOS’s complex scaling, security, and extensibility needs.

## Apache Mesos
### Pros
- Proven scalability at large scale
- Strong resource isolation and sharing
- Supports diverse workloads (containers, HPC, big data)
- Robust isolation between frameworks
- Adopted by major internet companies

### Cons
- Higher operational complexity than Kubernetes
- Requires Marathon or similar framework for container orchestration
- Smaller community and ecosystem
- Steeper learning curve
- Less focus on cloud-native patterns
- Fewer managed service offerings from cloud providers

### Decision
Not selected

### Reason
Although powerful, Mesos’ complexity and smaller ecosystem make it less suitable than Kubernetes, given Kubernetes’ extensive tooling, community support, and managed-service availability.

## Nomad
### Pros
- Simple to install and operate
- Integrates well with HashiCorp stack (Consul, Vault)
- Supports multiple workload types (containers, VMs, executables)
- Low resource overhead
- Emphasizes simplicity and usability

### Cons
- Fewer container-specific features than Kubernetes
- Smaller container-orchestration ecosystem
- Limited enterprise-grade features and compliance certifications
- Weaker built-in service discovery compared to Kubernetes + Consul
- Less mature for demanding stateful workloads

### Decision
Not selected

### Reason
Nomad’s simplicity sacrifices advanced container orchestration features essential for QEOS, such as sophisticated networking, storage options, and extensibility that Kubernetes provides natively.

## Managed Kubernetes Services (EKS, AKS, GKE)
### Pros
- Offloads control-plane operational overhead
- Managed upgrades and patching
- Tight integration with native cloud services
- SLA-backed managed offering
- Reduces depth of required Kubernetes expertise

### Cons
- Vendor lock-in to specific cloud providers
- Reduced control over cluster configuration and versioning
- Potential cost premium versus self-managed clusters
- Limited availability in certain regions or under specific compliance regimes
- Constraints on custom networking and storage solutions

### Decision
Not selected for primary decision (addressed separately)

### Reason
The choice to adopt Kubernetes as the orchestration platform is independent of the deployment model (self-managed vs. managed). This ADR addresses the platform selection; the managed-service option is considered separately.

# Implementation

## Affected Services
All containerized services: Platform Service, Execution Service, QIP Service, Automation Service, Collaboration Service, Administration Service, Marketplace Service, Integration Service, monitoring services, logging services, security services, and infrastructure services.

## Affected Domains
All domains: Platform, Execution, QIP, Automation, Collaboration, Administration, Marketplace, and Integrations

## Deployment Implications
- Deploy a Kubernetes cluster (self-managed or via managed service)
- Establish and manage a container image registry
- Integrate Kubernetes with CI/CD pipelines for build-and-deploy
- Host a Helm chart repository for reusable application packages
- Deploy monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager)
- Deploy logging stack (EFK or ELK)
- Implement a service mesh (Istio, Linkerd, or Kong Mesh)
- Choose ingress controllers for external access (NGINX, Traefik, cloud-specific)
- Provide backup and disaster-recovery solutions for etcd and persistent volumes

- Size clusters and manage node pools
- Define resource requests and limits for QoS
- Organize namespaces and enforce RBAC policies
- Apply network policies for service-to-service security
- Implement pod security standards and admission controllers
- Schedule regular upgrades and patching of Kubernetes components
- Perform capacity planning and configure autoscaling
- Establish backup and restore procedures for cluster state and application data
- Implement logging, monitoring, and alerting for cluster health
- Plan disaster recovery and business continuity

## Migration Considerations
**Phase 1**: Provision Kubernetes infrastructure (self-managed or managed)  
**Phase 2**: Containerize services and set up CI/CD pipelines  
**Phase 3**: Deploy core infrastructure services (monitoring, logging, etc.)  
**Phase 4**: Migrate domain services to Kubernetes in incremental batches  
**Phase 5**: Introduce service mesh for advanced traffic management  
**Phase 6**: Adopt GitOps workflows for declarative cluster management  
**Phase 7**: Enforce advanced security policies and compliance measures  
**Phase 8**: Optimize resource utilization and control costs
