# Run from QA Vision (Play and Stop v1) Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.
>
> **Execution: subagent-driven.** A fresh implementer subagent per task, a fresh reviewer per task, then one whole-branch review.

**Goal:** People press Play on a case, a selection of cases or a suite. QA Vision dispatches the customer's GitHub Actions workflow `qa-vision-run.yml` for exactly those scenarios, follows the run, and can stop it.

**Architecture:**
- **test-management-service** gains three tables (migration 004), a Fernet "secret box" for the GitHub token, a small GitHub REST client, and two routers: `ci-target` (the per-project repository, workflow, branch and token) and `run-requests` (Play, polling and Stop).
  - There is no worker. A `GET` of an active request refreshes it from GitHub, at most every 5 s.
- **The gateway** routes `ci-target` and `run-requests` to test-management.
- **The dashboard** adds:
  - a Settings section (owners and admins);
  - Play on a case, a selection and a suite, behind an inline confirmation;
  - a `role="status"` run panel with Stop;
  - a "Requested runs" tab under Runs.
- **The OBT side** is delivered as two template files under `templates/github/`, which the user copies into the OBT repository. This plan never commits to the OBT repository.

**Tech Stack:** FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2, Alembic, pydantic 2, httpx and respx (already used for outbound stubs), and `cryptography` (Fernet, new). React 18, TS, TanStack Query 5, vitest and msw 2, lucide-react. Node 22 `node:test` for the template script.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-run-from-qa-vision-design.md`. The spec is binding. Executors read it with this plan.

## Global Constraints

Copied from the spec. Every task implicitly includes all of them.

- **Roles:**
  - `GET ci-target`, `GET run-requests` and `GET run-requests/{rid}` are open to every project role.
  - `PUT ci-target` and `DELETE ci-target` are for `owner` and `admin`.
  - `POST run-requests` and `POST run-requests/{rid}/stop` are for `owner`, `admin` and `member`.
  - `viewer` and `billing_manager` see state only.
  - The Settings section "Run from QA Vision" is visible to `owner` and `admin` only.
- **Limits:**
  - `case_numbers` holds 1 to 200 entries, so at most 200 cases per run.
  - **At most one active QA Vision run per project.** A partial unique index on `run_requests.project_id` covers `status IN ('queued','running','cancelling')`.
  - A `GET` refreshes an active request when `checked_at` is older than **5 seconds**.
  - **2 minutes** after the request with no matched run (fallback only, after a 204 dispatch), the status becomes `failed_to_start` with "The workflow did not start".
  - The expiry warning starts **14 days** before `token_expires_at`.
  - After **5 minutes** without results, the panel says "Results not received: check the QA Vision upload step".
  - Workers are fixed at 1 and retries at 0.
- **Regexes and names:**
  - repo: `^[A-Za-z0-9-]{1,39}/[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,100}$`.
  - workflow: `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,100}\.ya?ml$`.
  - ref: a branch name, default `main`, following git branch-name rules (`git check-ref-format --branch`: no whitespace or control characters, none of `~ ^ : ? * [` or backslash, no `..`, `@{` or `//`, no leading or trailing `/`, no leading `-`, no trailing `.`, no part ending in `.lock`), at most 255 characters. Final fix wave A3.
  - OBT path: starts with `tests/features/`, ends with `.feature`, holds no control character and none of `\ : * ? " < > |`, and has no `..` segment. Arguments reach cucumber-js as an array, never through a shell.
  - Scenario selection is by file and **raw Gherkin scenario name**: `--name "^<name>$"`. In a Scenario Outline each `<placeholder>` becomes `.*`.
- **GitHub client:**
  - It uses `httpx` with a 10-second timeout and calls `https://api.github.com` only, **never following redirects**.
  - It sends `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` and `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28`.
  - The repo and workflow are validated by regex before they go into a URL.
  - A rate limit (403 or 429 with `x-ratelimit-remaining: 0`) is reported as "GitHub rate limit, try again in N s", and the request does not change state.
  - Token expiry comes from the `github-authentication-token-expiration` response header. It is NULL when the header is absent.
- **GitHub messages (PUT, 422), verbatim:**
  - 401: "token invalid or expired".
  - 403: "token has no Actions access to this repository".
  - 404: "repository or workflow not found. The workflow file must exist on the repository's default branch".
- **Secrets:**
  - The token is encrypted with Fernet from `cryptography`, keyed by the `TM_SECRETS_KEY` environment variable.
  - Without the key, `PUT ci-target` returns 503 with "Running tests from QA Vision is not configured on this server", and `GET` reports `"available": false`.
  - **No response, log line or error message ever carries the token.** Responses show `token_last4` only.
- **Matching and status:**
  - The dispatch is `POST /repos/{repo}/actions/workflows/{workflow}/dispatches` with `{ref, inputs: {paths, names, request_id}, return_run_details: true}`.
  - **On 200**, GitHub's body `{workflow_run_id, run_url, html_url}` gives the run directly. The row stores `github_run_id` and `github_run_url` (the `html_url`, only if it starts with `https://github.com/`) at once, so Stop works immediately.
  - **On 204 (fallback only)**, the row keeps no run id. Polling then lists runs with `event=workflow_dispatch` and `created>=` the request time minus 1 minute, and matches on `display_title == "QA Vision #<id>"`.
  - GitHub's `queued`, `waiting`, `requested` and `pending` map to `queued`. `in_progress` maps to `running`. `completed` maps to `completed`, or to `cancelled` when the conclusion is `cancelled`, and the `conclusion` is stored.
- **Dashboard copy, verbatim:**
  - Settings: "Connected: owner/name · token …a1b2 · expires 12 Mar 2027", "Last changed by <name> on <date>", "The GitHub token expires on <date>. Replace it in Settings", "Replace token" and "Disconnect".
  - Play: "Run", "Run selected (n)" and "Run suite".
  - Confirmation: "+n more", "`repo` @ `ref`", "Tests may create real bookings in staging", "Run" and "Cancel".
  - Disabled Play: "Configure in Settings" (linked), "Viewers can't run tests", "A run is in progress" and "GitHub token expired".
  - Panel: "Queued", "Running · n tests · started by <name> · <elapsed>", "Passed", "Failed", "Cancelled", "Didn't start: <error>", "View in GitHub", "Stop this run?", "Stopping…", "Stopped by <name>", "Waiting for results…" and "Results not received: check the QA Vision upload step".
- **Dashboard rules:**
  - Colours come from tokens only (`index.css` `:root` and its dark block).
  - Icons are lucide SVGs with `aria-hidden`. The panel is `role="status"`. Every control has a label and works by keyboard.
  - No `any`.
  - **Invoke the `ui-ux-pro-max` skill before any dashboard UI edit.**
- **Git:**
  - Work on `master` and never push.
  - Commit only your own paths: `git add <paths> && git commit -m "<msg>" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>" -- <paths>`.
  - Never `docker compose down -v`.
  - Never commit to `C:/dev/github/Atriis.Test.Automation.OBT`, which is read-only for this plan.
- **Test commands:**
  - **test-management**: from the service folder, `cd platforms/test-management-service`, run `SECRET_KEY=test .venv/Scripts/python -m pytest <target> -q` in Git Bash. The venv is Python 3.11 (`.venv/Scripts/python`). `SECRET_KEY` is the only env var the tests need; CI sets `SECRET_KEY: ci-test-secret`.
  - The tests share `./test.db`, so **never run two pytest processes in this service at once.**
  - **Dashboard**: from `dashboard/`, run `npx vitest run <file>`. Before reporting a dashboard task, run all four CI steps: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npx vitest run` and `npm run build`. Their output must be pristine.
  - msw runs with `onUnhandledRequest: "error"`, so every new request needs a handler (Task 7 adds global defaults).

## Rulings on spec gaps

These rulings apply to every task, and the reviewers check them.

1. **`paths` is a JSON array string, not space-separated.**
   - The spec's own path regex allows spaces, and OBT has `tests/features/shell/shell_approval_flows/29744_hotel_+_approval_flow _determined_by_the_financial_reference.feature`.
   - A space-separated list cannot carry that path, while `names` already uses JSON. So `inputs.paths` is `json.dumps([...deduplicated paths])`.
   - Controller ruling: the path rule is widened (see Global Constraints) so this file runs. The service stays repo-agnostic and does not mirror OBT's layout.
2. **Same scenario name in two selected files.**
   - The parser already skips a duplicate name inside one file.
   - Across files, `--name` applies to every selected path. Selecting "Log in" from `a.feature` together with any case from `b.feature` also runs a "Log in" scenario in `b.feature`.
   - v1 accepts this over-selection, and the README documents it.
3. **`GET ci-target` also returns `token_expires_at` and `last_change: {action, user_id, at} | null`**, the newest `ci_target_events` row, kept after a delete. The dashboard needs them for "expires …" and "Last changed by …".
4. **Response shapes:**
   - `POST run-requests` answers 201 with the row, even when the row is `failed_to_start`, so the panel shows "Didn't start: <error>".
   - The list answers `{total, items}`.
   - Each row carries `refreshing: bool`. It is true while the server still checks GitHub for it, and the dashboard polls while it is true.
   - A 409 for an active run carries `detail = {code: "run_active", message: "A run is in progress", run_request_id}`.
   - A 409 for Stop on a finished run carries `{code: "run_finished", message: "This run has already finished"}`.
5. **A GitHub rate limit answers 503 with `Retry-After`.** The dashboard's ErrorBanner replaces any 429 detail with a generic text. A rate-limited dispatch deletes the just-inserted `queued` row, so the state is unchanged.
6. **Token handling outside pydantic.**
   - The token is validated in the endpoint, because pydantic's 422 echoes `input` and would leak a near-valid token.
   - The token is stripped, then must match `^[A-Za-z0-9_]{20,255}$`.
   - `""` and `null` mean "keep the stored token".
7. **Event actions.**
   - A save without an existing target is `created`.
   - A save with a token on an existing target is `token_replaced`.
   - Any other save is `updated`.
8. **Stop of a `queued` request with no `github_run_id`.** This happens only after a 204 dispatch: a 200 dispatch stores the id at Play, so Stop cancels on GitHub at once. Such a request becomes `cancelled` locally with `stopped_by` and `stopped_at`. For 2 minutes after the request, `refreshing` stays true and a `GET` keeps looking for its run. When found, the service stores it and cancels it on GitHub.
9. **Matching (the 204 fallback only) is defensive.** Polling skips it whenever `github_run_id` is already known. `find_run` keeps only runs that:
   - have `event == "workflow_dispatch"`;
   - were created at or after `since`, checked client-side too;
   - are not already claimed by another request.
   Of those, it picks the oldest.
10. **The confirmation "dialog" is an inline, non-modal `role="dialog"` card.** DESIGN.md says "There is no modal". Focus moves to Cancel, and Escape cancels and returns focus to the trigger.
11. **Names** come from the organization members list (`email`), with "user #<id>" as fallback.
12. **When the panel shows.**
    - On Cases, the panel shows the newest request while it is active or `refreshing`, or when it was requested less than 60 minutes ago.
    - The 5-minute results clock starts at `checked_at`, the moment the end was seen.
    - On a case detail, the panel shows only while that case is in the active request.
13. **"Requested runs"** is the route `runs/requested`, with view tabs (Runs | Requested runs) like Cases | Suites.
14. **Disabled-reason precedence:**
    1. "Viewers can't run tests" (any role outside owner, admin and member);
    2. "Running tests from QA Vision is not configured on this server" (`available` false);
    3. "Configure in Settings" (link);
    4. "GitHub token expired" (link);
    5. "A run is in progress".
15. **`DELETE ci-target`** answers 409 on any active row. It does not refresh from GitHub first; the spec asks the pre-409 refresh only for Play.
16. **Repo names `.` and `..`** are rejected in addition to the spec regex.
17. **Template copies.** The dashboard keeps byte-identical copies of the two templates in `dashboard/src/templates/*.txt`, imported with `?raw`, with a vitest drift test. The dashboard Docker build context is `dashboard/` only, so `../templates` cannot be imported.
18. **The workflow template** guards the job with `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`. The help block replaces `main` with the configured branch.
19. **HTML report.** The script adds `--format html:test-results/cucumber-report.html`, because OBT's `cucumber.js` has no HTML formatter.
20. **`github_run_url`**, from the dispatch's `html_url` or from a matched run's `html_url`, is stored only if it starts with `https://github.com/`. Otherwise it is NULL, so the dashboard never renders an untrusted link.

## Review Focus

1. **Scenario names with regex characters, quotes, `$`, backslashes, `[ ]` or `|`** must select exactly that scenario and nothing longer or shorter.
   - Task 10: `regex characters, quotes and dollars in a name match only that name`.
   - Task 4: the raw name reaches the dispatch unchanged (`test_cases_become_files_and_raw_names_and_the_dispatch_body_is_exact`).
2. **Scenario Outline names with `<placeholders>`**, including a placeholder name with regex characters, must match every example row.
   - The case stores the raw outline name, not the first-example name. This is pinned in Task 1 (`test_import_records_the_raw_scenario_name_untruncated`).
   - The pattern is pinned in Task 10 (`an outline's placeholders match the example values cucumber-js puts in`).
3. **A token pasted with surrounding spaces or a trailing newline** must be trimmed, work, and show the right last 4. A malformed token must never be echoed in the 422. Task 3: `test_a_pasted_token_with_whitespace_is_trimmed` and `test_a_malformed_token_is_422_and_not_echoed`.
4. **A double click on Run** must dispatch once.
   - Task 4: `test_double_click_dispatches_once` (the second POST is 409, and the dispatch route is called once). The first request already holds its run id from the 200 dispatch, so the pre-409 refresh asks GitHub for that run, not for the run list.
   - Task 8: `a double click on Run starts one run`.
5. **A run from someone else's manual dispatch, or clocks that disagree (the 204 fallback).**
   - With a 200 dispatch, the run id comes from GitHub's answer and nothing is matched. Task 4: `test_a_200_dispatch_stores_the_run_at_once_and_polling_never_lists_runs`.
   - Only a `workflow_dispatch` run created since request time minus 1 minute, sent as UTC `...Z` (a `+00:00` offset would arrive as a space), and not already claimed, may match.
   - A run created 50 s "before" the request by GitHub's clock still matches.
   - Task 2: `test_find_run_skips_older_runs_other_events_and_claimed_ids` and `test_find_run_sends_created_in_utc_z`.
   - Task 4: `test_the_run_list_is_asked_from_a_minute_before_the_request_in_utc`.

## Task order and concurrency

| Chain | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 | All in `platforms/test-management-service` (6 also touches gateway, scripts and docs). Strictly sequential: one pytest process at a time, and each task consumes the previous one's interfaces. |
| Dashboard | 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 | All in `dashboard/` (10 also touches `templates/`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `TODO.md`). Sequential: shared files (`index.css`, `test/server.ts`, the pages) and one `npm run build` at a time. msw stubs the API, so this chain does not wait for the backend. |

**The two chains may run concurrently.** Their files are disjoint:
- `DESIGN.md` is only in Task 9 and `TODO.md` only in Task 10.
- README, `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`, the gateway and the smoke script are only in Task 6.

The manual end-to-end check at the end needs both chains done.

### Task 1: Migration 004, models, and `cases.scenario_name` filled by the import

**Files:**
- Create: `platforms/test-management-service/alembic/versions/004_run_from_qa_vision.py`
- Create: `platforms/test-management-service/src/casebook/models/ci.py`
- Modify: `platforms/test-management-service/src/casebook/models/case.py` (add `scenario_name` after `feature_name`)
- Modify: `platforms/test-management-service/src/casebook/models/__init__.py`
- Modify: `platforms/test-management-service/src/casebook/gherkin_import/plan.py` (`Existing.scenario_name`, `_differs`)
- Modify: `platforms/test-management-service/src/casebook/service/import_service.py` (`load_existing`, `_content`, create)
- Test: `platforms/test-management-service/tests/unit/test_migration.py` (append)
- Test: `platforms/test-management-service/tests/unit/test_import_plan.py` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  - `Case.scenario_name: Text | None`, the raw scenario name, untruncated.
  - From `src.casebook.models.ci`: `CiTarget`, `RunRequest`, `CiTargetEvent` (columns exactly as in the spec tables), plus `ACTIVE_STATUSES = ("queued", "running", "cancelling")`, `RUN_STATUSES` and `EVENT_ACTIONS = ("created", "updated", "token_replaced", "deleted")`.
  - All re-exported from `src.casebook.models`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing migration tests.** Append to `tests/unit/test_migration.py`:

```python
RUN = ("INSERT INTO run_requests (project_id, requested_by, requested_at, selection, status)"
       " VALUES (:project, 1, '2026-10-07 10:00:00', '[]', :status)")


def test_one_active_run_per_project(migrated_engine):
    with migrated_engine.begin() as conn:
        conn.execute(text(RUN), {"project": 1, "status": "running"})
        conn.execute(text(RUN), {"project": 1, "status": "completed"})
        conn.execute(text(RUN), {"project": 1, "status": "failed_to_start"})
        conn.execute(text(RUN), {"project": 2, "status": "queued"})
    for status in ("queued", "running", "cancelling"):
        with pytest.raises(IntegrityError), migrated_engine.begin() as conn:
            conn.execute(text(RUN), {"project": 1, "status": status})


def test_run_status_is_constrained(migrated_engine):
    with pytest.raises(IntegrityError), migrated_engine.begin() as conn:
        conn.execute(text(RUN), {"project": 1, "status": "paused"})


def test_downgrade_to_003_drops_the_run_tables_and_scenario_name(tmp_path):
    url = f"sqlite:///{(tmp_path / 'down4.db').as_posix()}"
    cfg = Config()
    cfg.set_main_option("script_location", str(SERVICE_ROOT / "alembic"))
    cfg.set_main_option("sqlalchemy.url", url)
    command.upgrade(cfg, "head")
    command.downgrade(cfg, "003")
    engine = create_engine(url)
    try:
        inspector = inspect(engine)
        assert not {"ci_targets", "run_requests", "ci_target_events"} & set(inspector.get_table_names())
        assert "scenario_name" not in {c["name"] for c in inspector.get_columns("cases")}
    finally:
        engine.dispose()
    command.upgrade(cfg, "head")  # and up again
```

The existing `test_migration_creates_every_model_table` and `test_migration_columns_match_models` then also cover the three new tables against the models.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing import tests.** Append to `tests/unit/test_import_plan.py`:

```python
OUTLINE = (
    "Feature: A\n"
    f"  Scenario: {'x' * 250}\n    Given x\n"
    "  Scenario Outline: Book <city> flight\n    Given <city>\n    Examples:\n      | city |\n      | Rome |\n"
)


def test_import_records_the_raw_scenario_name_untruncated(db):
    run(db, [(A, OUTLINE)])
    assert {c.scenario_name for c in db.query(Case).all()} == {"x" * 250, "Book <city> flight"}
    assert db.query(Case).filter(Case.scenario_name == "x" * 250).one().title == "x" * 200


def test_a_case_imported_before_scenario_names_gets_one_on_the_next_import(db):
    run(db, [(A, FEATURE)])
    for case in db.query(Case).all():
        case.scenario_name = None
    db.commit()
    assert run(db, [(A, FEATURE)]).summary()["updated"] == 2
    assert {c.scenario_name for c in db.query(Case).all()} == {"one", "two"}
    assert {i.action for i in import_service.plan_import(db, 1, [(A, FEATURE)], False).items} == {"unchanged"}


def test_a_manual_case_keeps_no_scenario_name(db):
    db.add(Case(project_id=1, number=1, title="manual", steps=[], created_by=1))
    db.commit()
    run(db, [(A, FEATURE)])
    assert db.query(Case).filter(Case.title == "manual").one().scenario_name is None
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the tests and check they fail.**

Run: `cd platforms/test-management-service && SECRET_KEY=test .venv/Scripts/python -m pytest tests/unit/test_migration.py tests/unit/test_import_plan.py -q`
Expected: FAIL (`no such table: run_requests`, `Case has no attribute scenario_name`).

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement the models.** `src/casebook/models/ci.py`:

- [ ] **Step 6: Make the import fill `scenario_name`.**
- In `gherkin_import/plan.py`:
  - add the field `scenario_name: Optional[str] = None` at the end of `Existing`;
  - in `_differs`, add `or case.scenario_name != scenario.name` to the returned expression. Cases imported before 004 then show as `update` once, as `feature_name` did with 003.
- In `service/import_service.py`:
  - `load_existing`: pass `scenario_name=r.scenario_name`;
  - `_content`: add `row.scenario_name = scenario.name` next to `row.feature_name = ...`;
  - the `create` branch: add `scenario_name=s.name` to `Case(...)`.

- [ ] **Step 7: Run the two files, then the whole suite, and check they pass.**

Run: `SECRET_KEY=test .venv/Scripts/python -m pytest tests/unit/test_migration.py tests/unit/test_import_plan.py -q`, then `SECRET_KEY=test .venv/Scripts/python -m pytest -q`
Expected: PASS. The existing duplicate-name parse test (`test_every_scenario_and_outline_becomes_one_case_and_duplicate_names_are_skipped`) still passes.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit.**

### Task 2: Secret box (Fernet) and the GitHub client

**Files:**
- Modify: `platforms/test-management-service/requirements.txt` (add `cryptography==43.0.3` after `httpx`)
- Modify: `platforms/test-management-service/src/casebook/core/config.py` (`TM_SECRETS_KEY`)
- Create: `platforms/test-management-service/src/casebook/utils/secret_box.py`
- Create: `platforms/test-management-service/src/casebook/utils/github_client.py`
- Modify: `platforms/test-management-service/tests/conftest.py` (fixtures `secrets_key`, `no_secrets_key` and `github`)
- Test: `platforms/test-management-service/tests/unit/test_secret_box.py`, `platforms/test-management-service/tests/unit/test_github_client.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces, in `secret_box`:
  - `NOT_CONFIGURED: str`;
  - `class SecretsUnavailable(Exception)`;
  - `is_available() -> bool`;
  - `encrypt(plain: str) -> str`;
  - `decrypt(ciphertext: str) -> str`. It raises `SecretsUnavailable` without a key, or when the ciphertext no longer opens.
- Produces, in `github_client`:
  - `API = "https://api.github.com"`, `REPO`, `WORKFLOW` (compiled regexes), `EXPIRY_HEADER`, `UNAUTHORIZED`, `FORBIDDEN` and `NOT_FOUND` (the verbatim messages);
  - `class GitHubError(Exception)` with `.status: int` (0 when there was no answer) and `.message: str`;
  - `class RateLimited(GitHubError)` with `.retry_after: int` and the message `"GitHub rate limit, try again in {n} s"`;
  - `parse_expiry(value: str | None) -> datetime | None`;
  - `github_time(moment: datetime) -> str`, which returns `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` in UTC;
  - `check_target(token, repo, workflow) -> datetime | None`, which returns the token expiry;
  - `class DispatchResult(NamedTuple)` with `run_id: int` and `html_url: str | None`;
  - `dispatch(token, repo, workflow, ref, inputs: dict) -> DispatchResult | None`. It sends `return_run_details: true`. A 200 with an integer `workflow_run_id` gives a `DispatchResult`. A 204, or a 200 without a usable id, gives `None`, and the caller falls back to matching;
  - `find_run(token, repo, workflow, title: str, since: datetime, exclude_ids: frozenset = frozenset()) -> dict | None`;
  - `get_run(token, repo, run_id: int) -> dict`;
  - `cancel_run(token, repo, run_id: int) -> None`.
  - Every function raises `ValueError` for a bad repo or workflow before any request.
- Produces, in conftest:
  - fixtures `secrets_key` (a fresh Fernet key) and `no_secrets_key` (`""`);
  - fixture `github`, a `GitHubStub` on the shared respx router. Its attributes are `repo = "acme/obt"` and `workflow = "qa-vision-run.yml"`. Its methods:
    - `check(status=200, workflow_status=None, expires="2027-03-12 00:00:00 UTC", headers=None)` returns the workflow route;
    - `dispatch(run_id=None, status=None, headers=None)`: with `run_id` it answers 200 `{workflow_run_id, run_url, html_url}` (the normal path); without it, 204 (the fallback) or the given `status`;
    - `runs(*runs)`, `run(body)` and `cancel(run_id, status=202)` each return their route;
    - `run_body(run_id, request_id, status="queued", conclusion=None, title=None, created_at="2026-10-07T10:00:05Z") -> dict`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the dependency and the setting, and install.**

In `requirements.txt`, after `httpx==0.27.0`, add `cryptography==43.0.3`.

In `core/config.py`, add this to `Settings`:

```python
    # Running tests from QA Vision: the Fernet key that encrypts each project's GitHub token.
    # Empty turns the feature off (GET ci-target says available=false, PUT answers 503). Generate one:
    #   python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
    TM_SECRETS_KEY: str = ""
```

Run: `.venv/Scripts/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
Expected: `Successfully installed cryptography-43.0.3 ...`

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the conftest fixtures.** Append to `tests/conftest.py`. Move `import httpx` to the top imports, and add `from cryptography.fernet import Fernet`.

```python

### Task 3: `ci-target` endpoints, encryption and the audit trail

**Files:**
- Create: `platforms/test-management-service/src/casebook/schemas/ci.py`
- Create: `platforms/test-management-service/src/casebook/service/ci_target_service.py`
- Create: `platforms/test-management-service/src/casebook/api/v1/endpoints/ci_target.py`
- Modify: `platforms/test-management-service/src/casebook/api/deps.py` (`MANAGE_ROLES`)
- Modify: `platforms/test-management-service/src/casebook/api/v1/api.py`
- Test: `platforms/test-management-service/tests/integration/test_ci_target.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 1's `CiTarget`, `CiTargetEvent`, `RunRequest` and `ACTIVE_STATUSES`, and Task 2's `secret_box` and `github_client`.
- Produces:
  - `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/ci-target` → `CiTargetOut`:

    ```json
    {"available": true, "configured": true, "provider": "github", "repo": "acme/obt", "workflow": "qa-vision-run.yml",
     "ref": "main", "token_last4": "a1b2", "token_expires_at": "2027-03-12T00:00:00Z", "updated_at": "...",
     "last_change": {"action": "created", "user_id": 7, "at": "..."}}
    ```

    When nothing is configured, the target fields are `null` and `configured` is `false`.
  - `PUT` with body `{repo, workflow="qa-vision-run.yml", ref="main", token?}` → `CiTargetOut`. Its errors:
    - 422 for a bad name, a bad token, a missing first token, or GitHub's 401, 403 or 404;
    - 503 when not configured, or on a GitHub rate limit (with `Retry-After`);
    - 502 when GitHub is unreachable or answers another error.
  - `DELETE` → 204; 404 with no target; 409 while a run is active.
  - `deps.MANAGE_ROLES = ("owner", "admin")`.
  - In `schemas.ci`:
    - `CiTargetIn` and `clean_token(raw: str | None) -> str | None`, which raises `ValueError`;
    - `CiTargetOut`, `CiTargetChange` and `DEFAULT_WORKFLOW = "qa-vision-run.yml"`.
  - In `ci_target_service`:
    - `TokenRequired`;
    - `now() -> datetime`;
    - `get_target(db, project_id) -> CiTarget | None`;
    - `out(db, project_id) -> dict`;
    - `save_target(db, project_id, user_id, repo, workflow, ref, token: str | None) -> CiTarget`;
    - `delete_target(db, project_id, user_id) -> bool`;
    - `has_active_run(db, project_id) -> bool`.

### Task 4: Run requests: Play, list, get, polling, refresh before 409, `failed_to_start`

**Files:**
- Modify: `platforms/test-management-service/src/casebook/schemas/ci.py` (run request schemas)
- Create: `platforms/test-management-service/src/casebook/service/run_request_service.py`
- Create: `platforms/test-management-service/src/casebook/api/v1/endpoints/run_requests.py`
- Modify: `platforms/test-management-service/src/casebook/api/v1/api.py`
- Test: `platforms/test-management-service/tests/integration/test_run_requests.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes:
  - Task 1's models;
  - Task 2's `github_client.dispatch` (returns `DispatchResult | None`), `find_run`, `get_run`, `GitHubError` and `RateLimited`, and `secret_box.decrypt` and `SecretsUnavailable`;
  - Task 3's `github_failure(exc, refused_status)` from `endpoints/ci_target.py`.
- Produces:
  - `POST /run-requests` with body `{case_numbers: [int≥1] (1..200)}` or `{suite_id: int}`, exactly one of the two. It answers 201 with `RunRequestOut`, or:
    - 412 when there is no target;
    - 422 for a bad selection (the message names the case numbers);
    - 404 for an unknown suite;
    - 409 `{code: "run_active", message, run_request_id}`;
    - 503 when not configured or rate-limited.
  - `GET /run-requests?limit=1..100 (20)&offset=0..` answers `{total, items: [RunRequestOut]}`, newest first.
  - `GET /run-requests/{request_id}` answers `RunRequestOut`, or 404.
  - `RunRequestOut`:

    ```
    {id, requested_by, requested_at, selection: [{case_number, path, name}], case_count, suite_id, status,
     conclusion, github_run_id, github_run_url, stopped_by, stopped_at, error, checked_at, refreshing}
    ```
  - In `run_request_service`:
    - the constants `THROTTLE = timedelta(seconds=5)`, `START_TIMEOUT = timedelta(minutes=2)`, `MATCH_WINDOW = timedelta(minutes=1)`, `MAX_CASES = 200`, `MAX_INPUT_CHARS = 65000` and `NOT_STARTED = "The workflow did not start"`;
    - the exceptions `NoTarget`, `BadSelection`, `SuiteNotFound` and `RunActive(request_id: int | None)`;
    - `now()`, `aware(dt)` and `run_title(request_id) -> "QA Vision #<id>"`;
    - `build_selection(db, project_id, case_numbers, suite_id) -> list[dict]`;
    - `dispatch_inputs(request_id, selection) -> dict`;
    - `active_request(db, project_id)`;
    - `needs_refresh(row, at) -> bool`;
    - `refresh(db, row, force=False)`;
    - `create(db, project_id, user_id, case_numbers, suite_id) -> RunRequest`;
    - `list_requests(db, project_id, limit, offset) -> (int, list)`;
    - `get_request(db, project_id, request_id)`;
    - `out(row) -> dict`;
    - `safe_run_url(url) -> str | None`, which keeps a URL only if it starts with `https://github.com/`;
    - the private helpers `_target_and_token`, `_match` and `_apply_github`, which Task 5 extends.
  - **Run id at Play.** After a 200 dispatch, `create` stores `github_run_id` and `github_run_url` before answering, and polling goes straight to `get_run`. Only after a 204 does the row keep no id. Then `_match` (title matching) and the 2-minute `failed_to_start` apply, as the fallback.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests.** `tests/integration/test_run_requests.py`:

### Task 5: Stop

**Files:**
- Modify: `platforms/test-management-service/src/casebook/service/run_request_service.py` (`AlreadyFinished`, `stop`, `_pending_cancel`, `needs_refresh`, `_apply_github`)
- Modify: `platforms/test-management-service/src/casebook/api/v1/endpoints/run_requests.py` (route)
- Test: `platforms/test-management-service/tests/integration/test_run_requests.py` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything in Task 4, and `github_client.cancel_run`.
- Produces:
  - `POST /run-requests/{request_id}/stop` answers 200 with `RunRequestOut`, or:
    - 409 `{code: "run_finished", message: "This run has already finished"}`;
    - 404 for an unknown request;
    - 403 for a viewer;
    - 412 or 503 as for Play;
    - 502 for another GitHub error.
  - In `run_request_service`: `class AlreadyFinished(Exception)`, `stop(db, row, user_id) -> RunRequest`, and `_pending_cancel(row, at) -> bool`.
  - **Normal path:** after a 200 dispatch the run id is known from Play, so Stop cancels on GitHub at once. **Fallback (204 only):** a request with no run id yet is cancelled locally, then cancelled on GitHub once matched.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests.** Append to `tests/integration/test_run_requests.py`:

```python
def known_run(project, auth, github, clock, status="in_progress"):
    """A request whose GitHub run (id 501, from the 200 dispatch) is in the given state."""
    github.dispatch(run_id=501)

    after = get(project, auth, rid)
    assert (after["status"], after["stopped_by"], after["refreshing"]) == ("cancelled", 7, False)

    assert r.status_code == 409 and r.json()["detail"]["code"] == "run_finished"
    assert not cancel.called


def test_a_run_that_ends_while_stopping_is_409(project, auth, github, clock):

    project_role("member")
    assert project.post(f"{URL}/9999/stop", headers=auth()).status_code == 404
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests and check they fail.**

Run: `SECRET_KEY=test .venv/Scripts/python -m pytest tests/integration/test_run_requests.py -q -k "stop or stopped or stopping"`.

`test_stop_right_after_play_cancels_the_run_at_once` and the `known_run` helper rely on Task 4's run id at Play. The two `after_a_204` tests cover the fallback.
Expected: FAIL (405 on `/stop`).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement.** In `run_request_service.py`, add these below `RunActive`:

```python
class AlreadyFinished(Exception):
    """Stop on a request that is no longer active."""
```

Replace `needs_refresh` and `_apply_github` with:

```python
def _pending_cancel(row: RunRequest, at: datetime) -> bool:
    """Stopped before GitHub listed its run: keep looking for 2 minutes, so it is cancelled there too."""
    return (row.status == "cancelled" and row.github_run_id is None and row.stopped_at is not None
            and at - aware(row.requested_at) < START_TIMEOUT)


def needs_refresh(row: RunRequest, at: datetime) -> bool:
    return row.status in ACTIVE_STATUSES or _pending_cancel(row, at)


def _apply_github(db: Session, row: RunRequest, target: CiTarget, token: str, at: datetime) -> None:
    if _pending_cancel(row, at):
        if _match(db, row, target, token) is not None:
            try:
                github_client.cancel_run(token, target.repo, row.github_run_id)
            except github_client.GitHubError as exc:
                if exc.status != 409:  # 409: it already ended, nothing left to cancel
                    raise
        return
    if row.github_run_id is None:
        run = _match(db, row, target, token)
        if run is None:
            if at - aware(row.requested_at) >= START_TIMEOUT:
                row.status, row.error = "failed_to_start", NOT_STARTED
            return
    else:
        run = github_client.get_run(token, target.repo, row.github_run_id)
    _map_status(row, run)
```

Add at the end of the file:

```python
def stop(db: Session, row: RunRequest, user_id: int) -> RunRequest:
    """Cancel on GitHub and mark cancelling. The run id normally came with Play (a 200 dispatch); only
    after a 204 can a request still have none: it is cancelled locally, then on GitHub once a GET matches it."""
    if row.status not in ACTIVE_STATUSES:
        raise AlreadyFinished()
    at = now()
    if row.github_run_id is None:
        row.status, row.stopped_by, row.stopped_at = "cancelled", user_id, at
        db.commit()
        return row
    target, token = _target_and_token(db, row.project_id)
    try:
        github_client.cancel_run(token, target.repo, row.github_run_id)
    except github_client.GitHubError as exc:
        if exc.status != 409:
            raise
        refresh(db, row, force=True)
        raise AlreadyFinished()
    row.status, row.stopped_by, row.stopped_at = "cancelling", user_id, at
    db.commit()
    return row
```

In `endpoints/run_requests.py`, add:

```python
@router.post("/{request_id}/stop", response_model=RunRequestOut)
def stop_run_request(
    request_id: int,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    access: ProjectAccess = Depends(require_project_role(*EDIT_ROLES)),
):
    row = _row_or_404(db, access, request_id)
    try:
        row = runs.stop(db, row, access.user_id)
    except runs.AlreadyFinished:
        raise HTTPException(status.HTTP_409_CONFLICT, detail={
            "code": "run_finished", "message": "This run has already finished"})
    except runs.NoTarget:
        raise HTTPException(status.HTTP_412_PRECONDITION_FAILED, detail=NO_TARGET)
    except secret_box.SecretsUnavailable as exc:
        raise HTTPException(status.HTTP_503_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE, detail=str(exc))
    except github_client.GitHubError as exc:
        raise github_failure(exc, status.HTTP_502_BAD_GATEWAY)
    return runs.out(row)
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the file, then the whole suite, and check they pass.**

Run: `SECRET_KEY=test .venv/Scripts/python -m pytest tests/integration/test_run_requests.py -q`, then `SECRET_KEY=test .venv/Scripts/python -m pytest -q`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**

```bash

### Task 6: Gateway, smoke, README, `.env.example`, compose

**Files:**
- Modify: `gateway/nginx.conf.template` (the test-management regex location, line ~154)
- Modify: `scripts/smoke_gateway.sh` (after the "case features" check, line ~118)
- Modify: `docker-compose.yml` (`x-testmgmt-env`, line ~58)
- Modify: `.env.example`
- Modify: `platforms/test-management-service/README.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Tasks 3, 4 and 5 routes.
- Produces: `/api/v1/projects/{id}/(ci-target|run-requests)` reach test-management through the gateway.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the smoke checks first.** In `scripts/smoke_gateway.sh`, after the `case features -> test-management-service` check:

```bash
check "ci target -> test-management-service" 200 GET "$BASE/api/v1/projects/$PROJECT_ID/ci-target" "${AUTH[@]}"
body_has "... says whether running from QA Vision is available" '"available"'
check "run requests -> test-management-service" 200 GET "$BASE/api/v1/projects/$PROJECT_ID/run-requests" "${AUTH[@]}"
body_has "... an empty list" '"total":0'
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the smoke and check it fails.** Run `set -a; . ./.env; set +a; docker compose up -d --build --wait test-management-service gateway`, then `bash scripts/smoke_gateway.sh`.
Expected: the two new checks FAIL. Without the route, project-service answers 404.

- [ ] **Step 3: Route, configure and document.**
- **`gateway/nginx.conf.template`:**

```nginx
        location ~ ^/api/v1/projects/[0-9]+/(cases|case-labels|case-folders|case-features|suites|ci-target|run-requests)(/|$) {
```

- **`docker-compose.yml`:** under `x-testmgmt-env`, add `TM_SECRETS_KEY: ${TM_SECRETS_KEY:-}`.
- **`.env.example`:** add after the Gherkin import limits:

```bash
# Running tests from QA Vision (test-management-service): the Fernet key that encrypts each project's
# GitHub token. Empty turns the feature off (Settings says so). Generate one with:
#   python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
# Changing it makes stored tokens unreadable: owners then save the token again in Settings.
#TM_SECRETS_KEY=
```

- **`platforms/test-management-service/README.md`:**
  - In "Run", the gateway list becomes `/api/v1/projects/{id}/(cases|case-labels|case-folders|case-features|suites|ci-target|run-requests)`.
  - Add these rows to the API table:

| Method | Path | |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/ci-target` | `{available, configured, provider, repo, workflow, ref, token_last4, token_expires_at, updated_at, last_change}`; every role; the token itself is never returned |
| `PUT` | `/ci-target` | owner or admin; `{repo, workflow="qa-vision-run.yml", ref="main", token?}`; the token is required on the first save; checked with GitHub first: 422 "token invalid or expired" (401), "token has no Actions access to this repository" (403), "repository or workflow not found. The workflow file must exist on the repository's default branch" (404); 503 without `TM_SECRETS_KEY` or on a GitHub rate limit |
| `DELETE` | `/ci-target` | owner or admin; 409 while a run is active; the audit trail (`ci_target_events`) is kept |
| `POST` | `/run-requests` | owner, admin or member; `{case_numbers: [1..200]}` or `{suite_id}`; 201 with the request (also when it is `failed_to_start`); 412 no target; 409 `run_active`; 422 names the cases that cannot run (manual, archived, unknown, or with no scenario name yet: re-import) |
| `GET` | `/run-requests?limit=&offset=` | `{total, items}`, newest first; an active request is refreshed from GitHub when last checked over 5 s ago; `refreshing` says whether to keep polling |
| `GET` | `/run-requests/{id}` | the same refresh rule |
| `POST` | `/run-requests/{id}/stop` | owner, admin or member; cancels on GitHub (`cancelling`, `stopped_by`); 409 `run_finished` |

  - Add a section `## Run from QA Vision (Play and Stop)`. It covers:
    - **Design:** link the spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-run-from-qa-vision-design.md`.
    - **Setup:**
      1. Set `TM_SECRETS_KEY` (the generation command, as in `.env.example`).
      2. Copy `templates/github/qa-vision-run.yml` to `.github/workflows/` and `templates/github/qa-vision-run.mjs` to `.github/scripts/` **on the repository's default branch** before the first Play. GitHub accepts `workflow_dispatch` only for a workflow on the default branch.
      3. Add the secret `QAV_API_KEY` and the variable `QAV_URL` in the repository.
      4. An owner or admin saves the repository and token in Project Settings.
    - **Limits:**
      - 200 cases per run;
      - one active run per project;
      - GitHub is polled at most every 5 s, only while someone views the run;
      - a run not seen 2 minutes after Play is `failed_to_start`;
      - workers 1, retries 0.
    - **Selection:**
      - Selection is by file and the raw scenario name. Outline placeholders match any value.
      - The same scenario name in two selected files runs in both.
      - A path the workflow's path rule rejects fails the job, with a message.
    - **After deploying migration 004:** run a full import once to fill `scenario_name`. Until then, Play on an old imported case answers 422 "re-import the .feature files first".
    - **Security note:**
      - **What the token can do:** a fine-grained token limited to one repository with "Actions: Read and write". It can start, cancel, re-run and delete that repository's workflow runs and logs, and read its workflow files. It cannot read or change code.
      - **At rest:** it is stored Fernet-encrypted with `TM_SECRETS_KEY` and never returned or logged. Responses show the last 4 characters.
      - **Who can do what:** owners and admins set and remove it. Owners, admins and members can run and stop.
      - **To revoke:** on GitHub, Settings › Developer settings › Fine-grained tokens › Revoke, then Disconnect in Project Settings.

- [ ] **Step 3b: Make sure the repo-root `.env` has a `TM_SECRETS_KEY`.** The end-to-end check needs it. The command generates a key with `Fernet.generate_key()` and appends it only if the variable is missing. It never prints the key: no `echo`, no `cat .env`, and nothing about it in the report beyond "present" or "added". Run it from the repo root in Git Bash:

```bash
grep -q '^TM_SECRETS_KEY=.' .env 2>/dev/null && echo "TM_SECRETS_KEY present" || {
  platforms/test-management-service/.venv/Scripts/python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; import sys; sys.stdout.write('TM_SECRETS_KEY=' + Fernet.generate_key().decode() + '\n')" >> .env
  echo "TM_SECRETS_KEY added"
}
```

`.env` is git-ignored, so it is never committed. If `.env` does not end with a newline, add one first (`[ -n "$(tail -c1 .env)" ] && printf '\n' >> .env`) so the key starts on its own line.

- [ ] **Step 4: Rebuild, run the smoke, and check it passes.** Run `set -a; . ./.env; set +a; docker compose up -d --build --wait test-management-service gateway`, then `bash scripts/smoke_gateway.sh`. Every check, the four new ones included, should be ok.

`test-management-migrate` runs `alembic upgrade head` (004) as a dependency of the service. Never use `down -v`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit.**

```bash
FILES="gateway/nginx.conf.template scripts/smoke_gateway.sh docker-compose.yml .env.example platforms/test-management-service/README.md"
git add $FILES && git commit -m "feat(gateway): route ci-target and run-requests; docs: Play and Stop, TM_SECRETS_KEY; smoke" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>" -- $FILES
```

### Task 7: Dashboard API client and the "Run from QA Vision" Settings section

**Files:**
- Create: `dashboard/src/api/runRequests.ts`
- Create: `dashboard/src/lib/useUserNames.ts`
- Create: `dashboard/src/components/CiTargetCard.tsx`
- Modify: `dashboard/src/pages/ProjectSettingsPage.tsx` (mount for owner and admin)
- Modify: `dashboard/src/test/server.ts` (global defaults)
- Modify: `dashboard/src/index.css` (`.warn-note`)
- Test: `dashboard/src/components/CiTargetCard.test.tsx`, `dashboard/src/pages/ProjectSettingsPage.test.tsx` (append)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 3's and Task 4's HTTP shapes. msw stubs them; no backend is needed.
- Produces, in `src/api/runRequests.ts`:

```ts
export interface CiTargetChange { action: "created" | "updated" | "token_replaced" | "deleted"; user_id: number; at: string }
export interface CiTarget { available: boolean; configured: boolean; provider: string | null; repo: string | null;
  workflow: string | null; ref: string | null; token_last4: string | null; token_expires_at: string | null;
  updated_at: string | null; last_change: CiTargetChange | null }
export interface CiTargetInput { repo: string; workflow: string; ref: string; token?: string }
export type RunRequestStatus = "queued" | "running" | "completed" | "cancelling" | "cancelled" | "failed_to_start";
export interface SelectedCase { case_number: number; path: string; name: string }
export interface RunRequest { id: number; requested_by: number; requested_at: string; selection: SelectedCase[];
  case_count: number; suite_id: number | null; status: RunRequestStatus; conclusion: string | null;
  github_run_id: number | null; github_run_url: string | null; stopped_by: number | null; stopped_at: string | null;
  error: string | null; checked_at: string | null; refreshing: boolean }
export type RunSelection = { case_numbers: number[] } | { suite_id: number };
export const MAX_RUN_CASES = 200;
export const EXPIRY_WARNING_DAYS = 14;
export function isActive(r: RunRequest): boolean;
export function tokenState(target: CiTarget, now?: number): "ok" | "expiring" | "expired";
export function formatDay(iso: string): string;          // "12 Mar 2027", in UTC
export function getCiTarget(projectId: number): Promise<CiTarget>;
export function saveCiTarget(projectId: number, body: CiTargetInput): Promise<CiTarget>;
export function deleteCiTarget(projectId: number): Promise<void>;
export function createRunRequest(projectId: number, selection: RunSelection): Promise<RunRequest>;
export function listRunRequests(projectId: number, q: { limit: number; offset: number }): Promise<{ total: number; items: RunRequest[] }>;
export function getRunRequest(projectId: number, requestId: number): Promise<RunRequest>;
export function stopRunRequest(projectId: number, requestId: number): Promise<RunRequest>;
```

- Also produces:
  - `useUserNames(projectId): (userId: number | null) => string`, which gives the email, or "user #<id>";
  - `CiTargetCard({ projectId })` (default export) and `ExpiryWarning({ target })` (named export);
  - the query key `["ci-target", projectId]`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Invoke `ui-ux-pro-max`.** Searches: `"settings form secret token field replace" --domain ux` and `"warning banner expiry accessible" --domain ux`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the global msw defaults.** Append these handlers inside `setupServer(...)` in `src/test/server.ts`:

```ts
  // Run from QA Vision: pages that show Play or the run panel ask for these; tests about them override
  http.get("/api/v1/projects/:projectId/ci-target", () =>
    HttpResponse.json({ available: true, configured: false, provider: null, repo: null, workflow: null, ref: null,
      token_last4: null, token_expires_at: null, updated_at: null, last_change: null })),
  http.get("/api/v1/projects/:projectId/run-requests", () => HttpResponse.json({ total: 0, items: [] })),
  // Names of the people who ran or stopped something
  http.get("/api/v1/organizations/:orgId/members", () => HttpResponse.json([])),
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the failing tests.** `src/components/CiTargetCard.test.tsx`:

```tsx

  const qc = new QueryClient({ defaultOptions: { queries: { retry: false } } });
  render(<QueryClientProvider client={qc}><MemoryRouter><CiTargetCard projectId={42} /></MemoryRouter></QueryClientProvider>);

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests and check they fail.**

Run: `cd dashboard && npx vitest run src/components/CiTargetCard.test.tsx src/pages/ProjectSettingsPage.test.tsx`
Expected: FAIL (`Failed to resolve import "./CiTargetCard"`).

- [ ] **Step 5: Implement the API client.** `src/api/runRequests.ts` holds the types from Interfaces, plus:

```ts
import { apiFetch, buildQuery } from "./http";

// Mirrors platforms/test-management-service/src/casebook/schemas/ci.py

export interface CiTargetChange { action: "created" | "updated" | "token_replaced" | "deleted"; user_id: number; at: string }

export interface CiTarget {
  /** False when the server has no TM_SECRETS_KEY: nothing can be configured. */
  available: boolean;
  configured: boolean;
  provider: string | null;
  repo: string | null;
  workflow: string | null;
  ref: string | null;
  token_last4: string | null;
  token_expires_at: string | null;
  updated_at: string | null;
  last_change: CiTargetChange | null;
}

export interface CiTargetInput {
  repo: string;
  workflow: string;
  ref: string;
  /** Only when setting or replacing it; without it the stored token is kept. */
  token?: string;
}

export type RunRequestStatus = "queued" | "running" | "completed" | "cancelling" | "cancelled" | "failed_to_start";

export interface SelectedCase { case_number: number; path: string; name: string }

export interface RunRequest {
  id: number;
  requested_by: number;
  requested_at: string;
  selection: SelectedCase[];
  case_count: number;
  suite_id: number | null;
  status: RunRequestStatus;
  conclusion: string | null;
  github_run_id: number | null;
  github_run_url: string | null;
  stopped_by: number | null;
  stopped_at: string | null;
  error: string | null;
  checked_at: string | null;
  /** True while the server still checks GitHub for this request: keep polling. */
  refreshing: boolean;
}

export type RunSelection = { case_numbers: number[] } | { suite_id: number };

export const MAX_RUN_CASES = 200;
export const EXPIRY_WARNING_DAYS = 14;
const DAY_MS = 86_400_000;
const base = (projectId: number) => `/api/v1/projects/${projectId}`;

export function isActive(r: RunRequest): boolean {
  return r.status === "queued" || r.status === "running" || r.status === "cancelling";
}

/** "expiring" from EXPIRY_WARNING_DAYS before token_expires_at; a token without expiry is always "ok". */
export function tokenState(target: CiTarget, now: number = Date.now()): "ok" | "expiring" | "expired" {
  if (!target.token_expires_at) return "ok";
  const expires = Date.parse(target.token_expires_at);
  if (expires <= now) return "expired";
  return expires - now <= EXPIRY_WARNING_DAYS * DAY_MS ? "expiring" : "ok";
}

/** "12 Mar 2027", read in UTC so the day never shifts with the viewer's time zone. */
export function formatDay(iso: string): string {
  return new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-GB", { day: "numeric", month: "short", year: "numeric", timeZone: "UTC" })
    .format(new Date(iso));
}

export function getCiTarget(projectId: number): Promise<CiTarget> {
  return apiFetch(`${base(projectId)}/ci-target`);
}

export function saveCiTarget(projectId: number, body: CiTargetInput): Promise<CiTarget> {
  return apiFetch(`${base(projectId)}/ci-target`, { method: "PUT", body: JSON.stringify(body) });
}

export function deleteCiTarget(projectId: number): Promise<void> {
  return apiFetch(`${base(projectId)}/ci-target`, { method: "DELETE" });
}

export function createRunRequest(projectId: number, selection: RunSelection): Promise<RunRequest> {
  return apiFetch(`${base(projectId)}/run-requests`, { method: "POST", body: JSON.stringify(selection) });
}

export function listRunRequests(projectId: number, q: { limit: number; offset: number }): Promise<{ total: number; items: RunRequest[] }> {
  return apiFetch(`${base(projectId)}/run-requests${buildQuery(q)}`);
}

  return apiFetch(`${base(projectId)}/run-requests/${requestId}`);
}

export function stopRunRequest(projectId: number, requestId: number): Promise<RunRequest> {
  return apiFetch(`${base(projectId)}/run-requests/${requestId}/stop`, { method: "POST", body: "{}" });
}
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Implement `useUserNames`.** `src/lib/useUserNames.ts`:

```ts
import { useCallback } from "react";
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { getProject, listMembers } from "../api/orgs";

/** A person's name for "started by", "stopped by" and "last changed by": their email from the
 *  organization's members, or "user #<id>" while it loads or when it is unknown. */
export function useUserNames(projectId: number): (userId: number | null) => string {
  const project = useQuery({ queryKey: ["project", projectId], queryFn: () => getProject(projectId) });
  const orgId = project.data?.organization_id;
  const members = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["org", orgId, "members"],
    queryFn: () => listMembers(orgId as number),
    enabled: orgId != null,
    staleTime: 5 * 60_000,
  });
  return useCallback(
    (userId: number | null) => {
      if (userId == null) return "someone";
      return members.data?.find((m) => m.user_id === userId)?.email ?? `user #${userId}`;
    },
    [members.data],
  );
}
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Implement `CiTargetCard`.** `src/components/CiTargetCard.tsx`:

```tsx
import { FormEvent, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useMutation, useQuery, useQueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { CheckCircle2, CircleAlert } from "lucide-react";
import { CiTarget, deleteCiTarget, formatDay, getCiTarget, saveCiTarget, tokenState } from "../api/runRequests";
import { useUserNames } from "../lib/useUserNames";
import ConfirmButton from "./ConfirmButton";
import ErrorBanner from "./ErrorBanner";

const DEFAULT_WORKFLOW = "qa-vision-run.yml";
const DEFAULT_BRANCH = "main";

/** Owners and admins see this from 14 days before the token expires (Settings and the run panel). */
export function ExpiryWarning({ target }: { target: CiTarget }) {
  const state = tokenState(target);
  if (state === "ok" || !target.token_expires_at) return null;
  const day = formatDay(target.token_expires_at);
  return (
    <p className="note warn-note" role="note">
      <CircleAlert size={16} aria-hidden="true" />
      <span>
        {state === "expired"
          ? `The GitHub token expired on ${day}. Replace it in Settings`
          : `The GitHub token expires on ${day}. Replace it in Settings`}
      </span>
    </p>
  );
}

/** Settings › Run from QA Vision: the repository, workflow, branch and token Play dispatches with. */
export default function CiTargetCard({ projectId }: { projectId: number }) {
  const qc = useQueryClient();
  const queryKey = ["ci-target", projectId];
  const target = useQuery({ queryKey, queryFn: () => getCiTarget(projectId) });
  const nameOf = useUserNames(projectId);
  const [repo, setRepo] = useState("");
  const [workflow, setWorkflow] = useState(DEFAULT_WORKFLOW);
  const [ref, setRef] = useState(DEFAULT_BRANCH);
  const [token, setToken] = useState("");
  const [replacing, setReplacing] = useState(false);

  const data = target.data;
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!data) return;
    setRepo(data.repo ?? "");
    setWorkflow(data.workflow ?? DEFAULT_WORKFLOW);
    setRef(data.ref ?? DEFAULT_BRANCH);
    setToken("");
    setReplacing(false);
  }, [data]);

  const save = useMutation({
    mutationFn: () => saveCiTarget(projectId, {
      repo: repo.trim(), workflow: workflow.trim(), ref: ref.trim(), ...(token.trim() ? { token: token.trim() } : {}),
    }),
    onSuccess: (saved) => qc.setQueryData(queryKey, saved),
  });
  const disconnect = useMutation({

    onSuccess: () => qc.invalidateQueries({ queryKey }),
  });

  function onSubmit(e: FormEvent) {
    e.preventDefault();
    save.mutate();
  }

  return (
    <div className="card">

In `index.css`, after `.note`, add:

```css
/* A warning note (token expiry, the Play confirmation): amber edge, text stays Ink */
.warn-note { display: flex; gap: var(--space-2); align-items: flex-start; border-color: var(--status-rerun); background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--status-rerun) 10%, transparent); }
.warn-note svg { color: var(--status-rerun); flex-shrink: 0; margin-top: 2px; }
```

In `ProjectSettingsPage.tsx`, import `CiTargetCard` and render it after the "Wire up your CI" card:

```tsx
      {project.data != null && MANAGE_ROLES.includes(project.data.my_role ?? "") && <CiTargetCard projectId={id} />}
```

- [ ] **Step 8: Run the tests and the four CI steps, and check they pass.**

Run: `npx vitest run src/components/CiTargetCard.test.tsx src/pages/ProjectSettingsPage.test.tsx`, then `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npx vitest run && npm run build`
Expected: PASS, with pristine output. If an existing test now trips over the new card, for example on an ambiguous `role="status"` for an owner, fix that test's query. Do not change the behaviour.

- [ ] **Step 9: Commit.**

```bash
D=dashboard/src
FILES="$D/api/runRequests.ts $D/lib/useUserNames.ts $D/components/CiTargetCard.tsx $D/components/CiTargetCard.test.tsx $D/pages/ProjectSettingsPage.tsx $D/pages/ProjectSettingsPage.test.tsx $D/test/server.ts $D/index.css"
git add $FILES && git commit -m "feat(dashboard): Run from QA Vision settings section" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>" -- $FILES
```

---

### Task 8: Play from a case, a selection and a suite, with the confirmation and disabled reasons

**Files:**
- Create: `dashboard/src/lib/useRunGate.ts`
- Create: `dashboard/src/components/RunControl.tsx`
- Modify: `dashboard/src/pages/CaseEditorPage.tsx` (Run on imported, non-archived cases)
- Modify: `dashboard/src/pages/CasesPage.tsx` (checkboxes, "Select all", the "Run selected (n)" bar)
- Modify: `dashboard/src/pages/SuiteDetailPage.tsx` ("Run suite")
- Modify: `dashboard/src/index.css` (Play, confirmation and selection styles)
- Test: `dashboard/src/pages/RunFromQaVision.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 7's `runRequests.ts` (types, `createRunRequest`, `listRunRequests`, `getCiTarget`, `isActive`, `tokenState`, `MAX_RUN_CASES`).
- Produces:

```ts
// src/lib/useRunGate.ts
export const RUN_POLL_MS = 5_000;
export type RunGate = { ok: true; target: CiTarget } | { ok: false; reason: string; toSettings: boolean };
export function useLatestRunRequest(projectId: number): UseQueryResult<RunRequest | null>; // key ["run-requests", id, "latest"], polls every 5 s while refreshing
export function useCiTarget(projectId: number): UseQueryResult<CiTarget>;                    // key ["ci-target", id]
export function useRunGate(projectId: number): RunGate | undefined;                          // undefined while loading
export function gate(role: string | undefined, target: CiTarget, latest: RunRequest | null, now?: number): RunGate;
// src/components/RunControl.tsx (default export)
export default function RunControl(props: { projectId: number; cases: { number: number; title: string }[];
  selection: RunSelection; label: string; onStarted?: () => void }): JSX.Element;
```

- [ ] **Step 1: Invoke `ui-ux-pro-max`.** Searches: `"confirmation before risky action inline" --domain ux`, `"bulk selection table sticky action bar" --domain ux` and `"disabled button reason text" --domain ux`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing tests.** `src/pages/RunFromQaVision.test.tsx`:

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the tests and check they fail.**

Run: `npx vitest run src/pages/RunFromQaVision.test.tsx`
Expected: FAIL (no "Run" button).

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement the gate.** `src/lib/useRunGate.ts`:

```ts
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { getProject } from "../api/orgs";
import { CiTarget, RunRequest, getCiTarget, isActive, listRunRequests, tokenState } from "../api/runRequests";

export const RUN_POLL_MS = 5_000;
// Mirrors EDIT_ROLES in test-management's api/deps.py: who may run and stop
const RUN_ROLES = ["owner", "admin", "member"];

export type RunGate = { ok: true; target: CiTarget } | { ok: false; reason: string; toSettings: boolean };

/** The project's newest run request; polled every 5 s while the server still checks it with GitHub. */
export function useLatestRunRequest(projectId: number) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ["run-requests", projectId, "latest"],
    queryFn: async (): Promise<RunRequest | null> => (await listRunRequests(projectId, { limit: 1, offset: 0 })).items[0] ?? null,
    refetchInterval: (query) => (query.state.data?.refreshing ? RUN_POLL_MS : false),
  });
}

export function useCiTarget(projectId: number) {
  return useQuery({ queryKey: ["ci-target", projectId], queryFn: () => getCiTarget(projectId) });
}

/** Whether Play may start a run, and if not the reason to show; first matching reason wins. */
export function gate(role: string | undefined, target: CiTarget, latest: RunRequest | null, now: number = Date.now()): RunGate {
  if (!RUN_ROLES.includes(role ?? "")) return { ok: false, reason: "Viewers can't run tests", toSettings: false };
  if (!target.available) return { ok: false, reason: "Running tests from QA Vision is not configured on this server", toSettings: false };
  if (!target.configured) return { ok: false, reason: "Configure in Settings", toSettings: true };
  if (tokenState(target, now) === "expired") return { ok: false, reason: "GitHub token expired", toSettings: true };
  if (latest && isActive(latest)) return { ok: false, reason: "A run is in progress", toSettings: false };
  return { ok: true, target };
}

/** Undefined while the role, the target or the newest request is still loading. */
export function useRunGate(projectId: number): RunGate | undefined {
  const project = useQuery({ queryKey: ["project", projectId], queryFn: () => getProject(projectId) });
  const target = useCiTarget(projectId);
  const latest = useLatestRunRequest(projectId);
  if (!project.data || !target.data || latest.isPending) return undefined;
  return gate(project.data.my_role, target.data, latest.data ?? null);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Implement `RunControl`.** `src/components/RunControl.tsx`:

```tsx
import { useEffect, useId, useRef, useState } from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { useMutation, useQueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { CircleAlert, Play } from "lucide-react";
import { RunSelection, createRunRequest } from "../api/runRequests";
import { useRunGate } from "../lib/useRunGate";
import ErrorBanner from "./ErrorBanner";

const SHOWN = 10;

interface Props {
  projectId: number;
  /** The cases the confirmation lists, in order. */
  cases: { number: number; title: string }[];
  selection: RunSelection;
  /** Visible text of the trigger: "Run", "Run selected (3)", "Run suite". */
  label: string;
  onStarted?: () => void;
}

/** Play: a trigger, the reason it is disabled, and an inline confirmation (no modal, DESIGN.md). */
export default function RunControl({ projectId, cases, selection, label, onStarted }: Props) {
  const gate = useRunGate(projectId);
  const qc = useQueryClient();
  const ids = useId();
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
  const sending = useRef(false); // a double click must send one request, before React re-renders
  const triggerRef = useRef<HTMLButtonElement>(null);
  const cancelRef = useRef<HTMLButtonElement>(null);

  const start = useMutation({
    mutationFn: () => createRunRequest(projectId, selection),
    onSuccess: async () => {
      await qc.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["run-requests", projectId] });
      setOpen(false);
      onStarted?.();
    },
    onSettled: () => {
      sending.current = false;
    },
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    if (open) cancelRef.current?.focus();
  }, [open]);

  function close() {
    setOpen(false);
    start.reset();
    triggerRef.current?.focus();
  }

  function confirm() {
    if (sending.current) return;
    sending.current = true;
    start.mutate();
  }

  const n = cases.length;
  const blocked = gate === undefined || !gate.ok || n === 0;
  return (
    <div className="run-control">
      <button ref={triggerRef} type="button" className="primary" disabled={blocked} onClick={() => setOpen(true)}
        aria-describedby={gate && !gate.ok ? `${ids}-why` : undefined}>
        <Play size={16} aria-hidden="true" /> {label}
      </button>
      {gate && !gate.ok && (
        <span id={`${ids}-why`} className="run-reason">
          {gate.toSettings ? <Link to={`/projects/${projectId}/settings`}>{gate.reason}</Link> : gate.reason}
        </span>
      )}
      {open && gate?.ok && (
        <div className="card run-confirm" role="dialog" aria-labelledby={`${ids}-title`}
          onKeyDown={(e) => { if (e.key === "Escape") close(); }}>
          <h3 id={`${ids}-title`}>{n === 1 ? "Run 1 test?" : `Run ${n} tests?`}</h3>
          <ul className="run-confirm-cases">
            {cases.slice(0, SHOWN).map((c) => <li key={c.number}>{`TC-${c.number} · ${c.title}`}</li>)}
          </ul>
          {n > SHOWN && <p className="muted">{`+${n - SHOWN} more`}</p>}
          <p>{`${gate.target.repo} @ ${gate.target.ref}`}</p>
          <p className="note warn-note" role="note">
            <CircleAlert size={16} aria-hidden="true" />
            <span>Tests may create real bookings in staging</span>
          </p>
          {start.error != null && <ErrorBanner error={start.error} />}
          <div className="button-row">
            <button type="button" className="primary" onClick={confirm} disabled={start.isPending}>
              {start.isPending ? "Starting…" : "Run"}
            </button>
            <button ref={cancelRef} type="button" onClick={close}>Cancel</button>
          </div>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

`userEvent.dblClick` on the dialog's Run button. The first click switches the label to "Starting…", and `sending` swallows the second click. The test holds the element reference, so the name change does not break it.

- [ ] **Step 6: Place Play on the three pages.**
- **`CaseEditorPage.tsx`:** import `RunControl`. Right after `<h2>…</h2>`, add:

```tsx
      {c?.source_path && c.status !== "archived" && (
        <RunControl projectId={id} cases={[{ number: c.number, title: c.title }]} selection={{ case_numbers: [c.number] }} label="Run" />
      )}
```

- **`SuiteDetailPage.tsx`:** import `RunControl`. After the description paragraph, add the code below. It runs the saved list; unsaved reorders are not sent.

```tsx
      <RunControl projectId={id} cases={suite.data.cases.map((c) => ({ number: c.number, title: c.title }))}
        selection={{ suite_id: sid }} label="Run suite" />
```

- **`CasesPage.tsx`:**
  - Import `Case` from `../api/cases`, `MAX_RUN_CASES` from `../api/runRequests`, and `RunControl`.
  - Add state and helpers:

```tsx
  const [picked, setPicked] = useState<Map<number, string>>(new Map());
  const runnable = (c: Case) => c.source_path != null && c.status !== "archived";
  function toggle(c: Case) {
    setPicked((now) => {
      const next = new Map(now);
      if (next.has(c.number)) next.delete(c.number);
      else if (next.size < MAX_RUN_CASES) next.set(c.number, c.title);
      return next;
    });
  }
  function toggleAll(on: boolean, rows: Case[]) {
    setPicked((now) => {
      const next = new Map(now);
      for (const c of rows) {
        if (!on) next.delete(c.number);
        else if (next.size < MAX_RUN_CASES) next.set(c.number, c.title);
      }
      return next;
    });
  }
```

  - Inside the `data.items.length > 0` branch, compute `const pageRunnable = data.items.filter(runnable);`.
  - When `canEdit`, add a first header cell:

```tsx
<th className="select-col">
  <input type="checkbox" aria-label="Select all imported cases on this page" disabled={pageRunnable.length === 0}
    checked={pageRunnable.length > 0 && pageRunnable.every((c) => picked.has(c.number))}
    onChange={(e) => toggleAll(e.target.checked, pageRunnable)} />
</th>
```

  - When `canEdit`, add a first row cell:

```tsx
<td className="select-col">
  {runnable(c) && (
    <input type="checkbox" aria-label={`Select ${c.key} ${c.title}`} checked={picked.has(c.number)}
      disabled={!picked.has(c.number) && picked.size >= MAX_RUN_CASES} onChange={() => toggle(c)} />
  )}
</td>
```

  - Above the table card, when `canEdit && picked.size > 0`:

```tsx
<div className="run-selection" role="region" aria-label="Selected cases">
  <RunControl projectId={id} cases={[...picked].map(([number, title]) => ({ number, title }))}
    selection={{ case_numbers: [...picked.keys()] }} label={`Run selected (${picked.size})`}
    onStarted={() => setPicked(new Map())} />
  <button type="button" className="ghost" onClick={() => setPicked(new Map())}>Clear selection</button>
  {picked.size >= MAX_RUN_CASES && <span className="muted">At most 200 cases per run</span>}
</div>
```

- **CSS:** in `index.css`, add:

```css
/* Run from QA Vision: Play, the reason it is disabled, the inline confirmation and the selection bar */
.run-control { display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: center; gap: var(--space-2) var(--space-3); margin: var(--space-3) 0; }
.run-control > button svg { vertical-align: -3px; }
.run-reason { color: var(--text-secondary); font-size: 13px; }
.run-confirm { flex-basis: 100%; max-width: 560px; margin: 0; }
.run-confirm h3 { margin-top: 0; }
.run-confirm-cases { margin: 0 0 var(--space-2); padding-left: var(--space-5); overflow-wrap: anywhere; }
.run-selection { position: sticky; bottom: 0; z-index: 1; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: center; gap: var(--space-3); padding: var(--space-3) var(--space-4); margin: var(--space-3) 0; background: var(--surface-1); border: 1px solid var(--border-strong); border-radius: var(--radius); box-shadow: var(--shadow-2); }
.run-selection .run-control { margin: 0; }
.select-col { width: 36px; }
.select-col input { width: 18px; height: 18px; }
@media (pointer: coarse) { .select-col input { width: 24px; height: 24px; } }
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Run the tests and the four CI steps, and check they pass.**

Run: `npx vitest run src/pages/RunFromQaVision.test.tsx`, then `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npx vitest run && npm run build`
Expected: PASS, with pristine output. `TestManagement.test.tsx` renders imported cases as a member. If a new checkbox or Run button makes one of its queries ambiguous, narrow that query with `within(...)`. Do not change the behaviour.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit.**

```bash
D=dashboard/src
FILES="$D/lib/useRunGate.ts $D/components/RunControl.tsx $D/pages/CaseEditorPage.tsx $D/pages/CasesPage.tsx $D/pages/SuiteDetailPage.tsx $D/pages/RunFromQaVision.test.tsx $D/index.css"
git add $FILES && git commit -m "feat(dashboard): Play from a case, a selection and a suite, with a confirmation" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>" -- $FILES
```

Add `dashboard/src/pages/TestManagement.test.tsx` to `FILES` only if you had to touch it.

### Task 9: Run panel with Stop, and the "Requested runs" tab

**Files:**
- Create: `dashboard/src/lib/runStatus.ts`
- Create: `dashboard/src/components/RunPanel.tsx`
- Create: `dashboard/src/pages/RequestedRunsPage.tsx`
- Modify: `dashboard/src/pages/CasesPage.tsx` (panel at the top)
- Modify: `dashboard/src/pages/CaseEditorPage.tsx` (panel for this case)
- Modify: `dashboard/src/pages/RunsPage.tsx` (view tabs)
- Modify: `dashboard/src/App.tsx` (route `runs/requested`)
- Modify: `dashboard/src/index.css` (panel)
- Modify: `DESIGN.md` (a new "Run from QA Vision" component section)
- Test: `dashboard/src/components/RunPanel.test.tsx`, `dashboard/src/pages/RequestedRunsPage.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes:
  - Task 7's `runRequests.ts`, `useUserNames` and `ExpiryWarning`;
  - Task 8's `useLatestRunRequest`, `useCiTarget` and `RUN_POLL_MS`;
  - `listRuns` and `Run` from `api/runs.ts`, and `formatDuration` from `api/analytics.ts`.
- Produces:

```ts
// src/lib/runStatus.ts
export type RunTone = "queued" | "running" | "passed" | "failed" | "cancelled" | "error";
export const RESULTS_WAIT_MS = 5 * 60_000;
export const MATCH_SLACK_MS = 10 * 60_000;
export function describeRun(r: RunRequest, nameOf: (id: number | null) => string, now?: number): { text: string; tone: RunTone };
export function matchRun(runs: Run[], url: string | null): Run | undefined; // ci_run_url equal, ignoring case
// src/components/RunPanel.tsx (default export)
export default function RunPanel(props: { projectId: number; caseNumber?: number }): JSX.Element | null;
// src/pages/RequestedRunsPage.tsx (default export), route /projects/:projectId/runs/requested
```

- [ ] **Step 1: Invoke `ui-ux-pro-max`.** Searches: `"live status region progress polling" --domain ux`, `"stop running job confirmation" --domain ux` and `"status icon not color only" --domain ux`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the tests and check they fail.**

Run: `npx vitest run src/components/RunPanel.test.tsx src/pages/RequestedRunsPage.test.tsx`
Expected: FAIL (imports do not resolve).

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement `runStatus.ts`.**

```ts

import { Run } from "../api/runs";

export type RunTone = "queued" | "running" | "passed" | "failed" | "cancelled" | "error";

      return { text: `Running · ${tests} · started by ${nameOf(r.requested_by)} · ${elapsed}`, tone: "running" };
    }
    case "cancelling":

    case "cancelled":
      return { text: r.stopped_by != null ? `Stopped by ${nameOf(r.stopped_by)}` : "Cancelled", tone: "cancelled" };

  if (!url) return undefined;
  const wanted = url.toLowerCase();
  return runs.find((r) => r.ci_run_url?.toLowerCase() === wanted);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Implement `RunPanel.tsx`.**

```tsx
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

};

interface Props {

/** The newest run requested from QA Vision: its state, View in GitHub, Stop, then its results. */
export default function RunPanel({ projectId, caseNumber }: Props) {
  const qc = useQueryClient();
  const latest = useLatestRunRequest(projectId);
  const target = useCiTarget(projectId);
  const project = useQuery({ queryKey: ["project", projectId], queryFn: () => getProject(projectId) });

    refetchInterval: (q) => (q.state.data || waitedTooLong ? false : RESULTS_POLL_MS),
  });
  const stop = useMutation({
    mutationFn: () => stopRunRequest(projectId, r!.id),
    onSuccess: (updated) => qc.setQueryData(["run-requests", projectId, "latest"], updated),
  });

  const role = project.data?.my_role ?? "";
  const warning = MANAGE_ROLES.includes(role) && target.data ? <ExpiryWarning target={target.data} /> : null;
  const live = r != null && (isActive(r) || r.refreshing);
  const visible = r != null && (caseNumber === undefined

  if (!visible || r == null) return caseNumber === undefined ? warning : null;

  const { text, tone } = describeRun(r, nameOf);
  const Icon = ICONS[tone];
  const canStop = RUN_ROLES.includes(role) && (r.status === "queued" || r.status === "running");
  return (
    <>
      {warning}
      <section className={`card run-panel run-tone-${tone}`} role="status" aria-label="Run from QA Vision">

        </div>
        {ended && r.github_run_url && r.status !== "failed_to_start" && (

          ) : waitedTooLong ? (

        )}
        {stop.error != null && <ErrorBanner error={stop.error} />}
      </section>
    </>
  );
}
```

If the linter rejects the non-null assertions (`r!`), capture `const rid = r?.id` and `const requestedAt = r?.requested_at` before the queries, and guard inside `queryFn` with an early `return null`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Implement `RequestedRunsPage.tsx`, the tab and the route.**

```tsx

  });
  const items = list.data?.items ?? [];
  const oldest = items.length > 0 ? Math.min(...items.map((r) => Date.parse(r.requested_at))) : null;
  const runs = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["run-requests", id, "page-results", offset, oldest],
    queryFn: () => listRuns(id, { limit: 100, offset: 0, since: new Date((oldest ?? 0) - MATCH_SLACK_MS).toISOString() }),
    enabled: oldest !== null && items.some((r) => r.github_run_url),
  });

  return (

```

`App.tsx`: add `<Route path="runs/requested" element={<RequestedRunsPage />} />` before `runs/:runId`, and import it.

`RunsPage.tsx`: right after `<h2 className="sr-only">Runs</h2>`, add:

```tsx
      <div className="view-tabs">
        <span aria-current="page">Runs</span>
        <Link to="requested">Requested runs</Link>
      </div>
```

- **`CasesPage.tsx`:** import `RunPanel`, and render `<RunPanel projectId={id} />` right after the `view-tabs` div.
- **`CaseEditorPage.tsx`:** import `RunPanel`, and render `{c && <RunPanel projectId={id} caseNumber={c.number} />}` right after the Run control.

CSS, in `index.css`:

```css
/* Run from QA Vision: the run panel (a role="status" card) */
.run-panel { display: grid; gap: var(--space-2); margin-bottom: var(--space-4); }
.run-panel-state { display: flex; align-items: center; gap: var(--space-2); margin: 0; font-weight: 600; }

```

**`DESIGN.md`:** add `### Run from QA Vision` under Components, after "Run Strip". Cover:
- **Play:** a Primary button with the Play icon ("Run", "Run selected (n)", "Run suite"). When disabled, the reason sits beside it in Graphite text, linked when Settings can fix it.
- **Confirmation:** an inline, non-modal card with `role="dialog"` that lists up to 10 cases then "+n more", `repo @ branch`, and the amber `.warn-note` "Tests may create real bookings in staging". Focus goes to Cancel, Escape backs out, and Run reads "Starting…" and ignores a second click.
- **Selection bar:** sticky at the bottom of the list, with checkboxes on imported rows for editors only. A 200-case cap disables the remaining boxes.
- **Run panel:** a card with `role="status"`. It has one state line with an 18px lucide icon whose shape differs per state (clock, spinning loader, check, cross, slash, alert), with colours from tokens. It has "View in GitHub". Stop uses the Destructive Confirmation pattern ("Stop this run?" then "Stop run"), then "Stopping…", then "Stopped by <name>". The results line says "Waiting for results…", or links the results, or after 5 minutes "Results not received: check the QA Vision upload step".
- **Token expiry:** the amber `.warn-note` for owners and admins, from 14 days before expiry.
- **Requested runs:** a tab beside Runs.

- [ ] **Step 7: Run the tests and the four CI steps, and check they pass.**

Run: `npx vitest run src/components/RunPanel.test.tsx src/pages/RequestedRunsPage.test.tsx`, then `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npx vitest run && npm run build`
Expected: PASS, with pristine output. If the fake-timer polling test is flaky in this vitest version, replace the two `advanceTimersByTimeAsync` calls with real waiting. Use `await screen.findByText("Failed", undefined, { timeout: 7000 })`, then `await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 6000))` before the final count. Keep the same assertions.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit.**

### Task 10: The `qa-vision-run` workflow template, its script, the help block, and TODO

**Files:**
- Create: `templates/github/qa-vision-run.yml`
- Create: `templates/github/qa-vision-run.mjs`
- Create: `templates/github/qa-vision-run.test.mjs`
- Create: `dashboard/src/templates/qa-vision-run.yml.txt` and `dashboard/src/templates/qa-vision-run.mjs.txt` (byte-identical copies)
- Create: `dashboard/src/templates/templates.test.ts` (drift)
- Modify: `dashboard/src/components/CiTargetCard.tsx` (help block)
- Modify: `dashboard/src/components/CiTargetCard.test.tsx` (help test)
- Modify: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (dashboard job: a template test step)
- Modify: `TODO.md` (section B)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the dispatch inputs from Task 4: `paths` (a JSON array string), `names` (a JSON array string) and `request_id`. Also Task 7's `CiTargetCard`.
- Produces, from `templates/github/qa-vision-run.mjs`:

```js
export function parsePaths(raw: string | undefined): string[];   // throws unless under tests/features/, ending .feature, without control or reserved characters or ".."
export function parseNames(raw: string | undefined): string[];   // throws unless a non-empty JSON array of non-empty strings
export function namePattern(name: string): string;               // "^" + escaped name with <placeholder> -> ".*" + "$"
export function cucumberArgs(paths: string[], names: string[]): string[];
export function countScenarios(report: unknown): number;
```

The user copies `qa-vision-run.yml` into the OBT repository's `.github/workflows/` and `qa-vision-run.mjs` into `.github/scripts/`. **This task does not touch the OBT repository.**

- [ ] **Step 1: Invoke `ui-ux-pro-max`** for the help block. Search: `"setup instructions code block copy" --domain ux`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing script tests.** `templates/github/qa-vision-run.test.mjs`:

```js
import { test } from "node:test";
import assert from "node:assert/strict";
import { countScenarios, cucumberArgs, namePattern, parseNames, parsePaths } from "./qa-vision-run.mjs";

const matches = (name, actual) => new RegExp(namePattern(name)).test(actual);

  const name = `Pay with a "voucher" (50% off) $5 [promo] *now*? a+b|c \\ d. ^x {2} it's`;
  assert.ok(matches(name, name));
  assert.ok(!matches(name, `${name} again`));
  assert.ok(!matches(name, `X${name}`));

  assert.ok(!matches("Book <city> flight", "Book Rome train"));
  assert.ok(matches("<carrier> flights are flagged as eligible for the traveler's unused ticket",
    "TAP Air Portugal (TP) flights are flagged as eligible for the traveler's unused ticket"));
  assert.ok(matches("Price <a.b> (<x|y>)", "Price 1.5 (yes)"));
});

test("paths must be .feature files under tests/features, never with ..", () => {
  assert.deepEqual(
    parsePaths('["tests/features/a.feature","tests/features/a.feature","tests/features/b c.feature","tests/features/x_+_y (1).feature"]'),

    "[]", "not json", undefined]) {
    assert.throws(() => parsePaths(bad), undefined, String(bad));
  }
});

test("names must be a non-empty JSON array of non-empty strings", () => {
  assert.deepEqual(parseNames('["a", "b <c>"]'), ["a", "b <c>"]);
  for (const bad of ["[]", '[""]', "[1]", '{"a":1}', "nope", undefined]) assert.throws(() => parseNames(bad));
});

test("cucumber-js gets one --name per scenario as an argument array, with workers 1 and retries 0", () => {
  assert.deepEqual(cucumberArgs(["tests/features/a.feature"], ['say "hi"', "x"]), [
    "cucumber-js", "tests/features/a.feature", "--name", '^say "hi"$', "--name", "^x$",
    "--profile", "ci", "--format", "html:test-results/cucumber-report.html", "--parallel", "1", "--retry", "0",
  ]);
});

test("scenarios are counted from the cucumber JSON report, backgrounds left out", () => {
  assert.equal(countScenarios([{ elements: [{ type: "background" }, { type: "scenario" }] }, { elements: [{ type: "scenario" }] }]), 2);
  assert.equal(countScenarios([]), 0);
  assert.equal(countScenarios({}), 0);
});
```

Run: `node --test templates/github/qa-vision-run.test.mjs`
Expected: FAIL (`Cannot find module './qa-vision-run.mjs'`).

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the script.** `templates/github/qa-vision-run.mjs`:

```js

// Copy to .github/scripts/qa-vision-run.mjs in the test repository.

```

Run: `node --test templates/github/qa-vision-run.test.mjs`
Expected: PASS (6 tests).

- [ ] **Step 4: Write the workflow.** `templates/github/qa-vision-run.yml`:

```yaml
# QA Vision: run selected scenarios on demand (QA-Vision-Platform docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-run-from-qa-vision-design.md).
# Copy to .github/workflows/qa-vision-run.yml on the repository's DEFAULT branch (GitHub dispatches only
# workflows found there) and qa-vision-run.mjs to .github/scripts/qa-vision-run.mjs.
# Needs the repository secret QAV_API_KEY and the repository variable QAV_URL; the ENV secret feeds
# ./.github/actions/setup-test-env as in the other suites.
name: QA Vision run
run-name: "QA Vision #${{ inputs.request_id }}"

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      paths:
        description: JSON array of .feature paths (set by QA Vision)
        required: true
        type: string
      names:

        required: true
        type: string
      request_id:
        description: QA Vision run request id
        required: true
        type: string

permissions:

    name: QA Vision run
    # Only the branch configured in QA Vision (Project Settings › Run from QA Vision)
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    timeout-minutes: 120
    concurrency:
      group: qa-vision-run
      cancel-in-progress: false
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@93cb6efe18208431cddfb8368fd83d5badbf9bfd # v5

      - uses: ./.github/actions/setup-test-env

          env-file-content: ${{ secrets.ENV }}

      - name: Run the selected scenarios
        run: node .github/scripts/qa-vision-run.mjs
        env:

          path: test-results/cucumber-report.html
          if-no-files-found: ignore
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Make the dashboard copies, and write the failing dashboard tests.** Copy both files byte for byte:

```bash
cp templates/github/qa-vision-run.yml dashboard/src/templates/qa-vision-run.yml.txt
cp templates/github/qa-vision-run.mjs dashboard/src/templates/qa-vision-run.mjs.txt
```

`dashboard/src/templates/templates.test.ts`:

```ts
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";
import { fileURLToPath } from "node:url";
import workflowYaml from "./qa-vision-run.yml.txt?raw";
import runnerScript from "./qa-vision-run.mjs.txt?raw";

// The dashboard's Docker build sees only dashboard/, so the help block reads these copies; they must
// stay identical to the templates people copy from the repository.
const repoFile = (name: string) =>
  readFileSync(fileURLToPath(new URL(`../../../templates/github/${name}`, import.meta.url)), "utf8");

test("the dashboard's copies match templates/github", () => {
  expect(workflowYaml).toBe(repoFile("qa-vision-run.yml"));
  expect(runnerScript).toBe(repoFile("qa-vision-run.mjs"));
});
```

Append to `dashboard/src/components/CiTargetCard.test.tsx`:

```tsx
test("the help block holds the workflow for the configured branch and the script, ready to copy", async () => {
  server.use(http.get(`${P}/ci-target`, () => HttpResponse.json({ ...CONNECTED, ref: "release" })));
  renderCard();
  await userEvent.click(await screen.findByText("How to set it up"));
  const workflow = screen.getByLabelText("qa-vision-run.yml");
  expect(workflow).toHaveTextContent("if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/release'");
  expect(workflow).toHaveTextContent('run-name: "QA Vision #${{ inputs.request_id }}"');
  expect(screen.getByLabelText("qa-vision-run.mjs")).toHaveTextContent('"--retry", "0"');
  expect(screen.getByText(/Actions: Read and write/)).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByRole("button", { name: "Copy qa-vision-run.yml" })).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByRole("button", { name: "Copy qa-vision-run.mjs" })).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

Run: `npx vitest run src/templates/templates.test.ts src/components/CiTargetCard.test.tsx`
Expected: the drift test passes, because the files were just copied. The help test FAILS (no "How to set it up").

- [ ] **Step 6: Add the help block.** In `CiTargetCard.tsx`:

```tsx
import workflowYaml from "../templates/qa-vision-run.yml.txt?raw";
import runnerScript from "../templates/qa-vision-run.mjs.txt?raw";

/** The template, guarded to the branch configured here. */
function workflowFor(ref: string | null): string {
  return ref ? workflowYaml.replace("refs/heads/main", `refs/heads/${ref}`) : workflowYaml;
}

function CopyBlock({ name, code }: { name: string; code: string }) {
  const [copied, setCopied] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <pre className="code-block" tabIndex={0} aria-label={name}><code>{code}</code></pre>
      <button type="button" aria-label={`Copy ${name}`} onClick={async () => {
        try {
          await navigator.clipboard.writeText(code);
          setCopied(true);
        } catch {
          setCopied(false); // clipboard blocked: the text stays selectable
        }
      }}>
        {copied ? "Copied" : "Copy"}
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Render this inside the `data?.available` fragment, after the Disconnect control:

```tsx
          <details className="run-help">
            <summary>How to set it up</summary>
            <ol>
              <li>
                On GitHub, create a <strong>fine-grained personal access token</strong> (Settings › Developer settings ›
                Fine-grained tokens): repository access <strong>only {data.repo ?? "this repository"}</strong>, permission{" "}
                <strong>Actions: Read and write</strong>. Paste it in Token above.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add this workflow as <code>.github/workflows/qa-vision-run.yml</code> on the repository's{" "}
                <strong>default branch</strong> (GitHub only dispatches workflows found there):
                <CopyBlock name="qa-vision-run.yml" code={workflowFor(data.ref)} />
              </li>
              <li>
                Add the script it runs as <code>.github/scripts/qa-vision-run.mjs</code>:
                <CopyBlock name="qa-vision-run.mjs" code={runnerScript} />
              </li>
              <li>
                In the repository's Settings › Secrets and variables › Actions, add the secret <code>QAV_API_KEY</code>{" "}
                (a project API key from this page) and the variable <code>QAV_URL</code> ={" "}
                <code>{window.location.origin}</code>.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </details>
```

In `index.css`, add:

```css
.run-help { margin-top: var(--space-4); }
.run-help summary { cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600; }
.run-help li { margin-bottom: var(--space-3); }
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Add the CI step.** In `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, in the `dashboard` job after the `Tests` step (working directory `dashboard`), add:

```yaml
      - name: Workflow template tests (templates/github)
        run: node --test ../templates/github/qa-vision-run.test.mjs
```

- [ ] **Step 8: Update `TODO.md` section B.**
- Mark `Run a single TC, a selection ("bunch"), or a whole suite` and `First version triggers the customer's CI (GitHub Actions workflow_dispatch)…` as `[x]`, with "(v1 Play and Stop, 2026-10-07; spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-07-run-from-qa-vision-design.md`)".
- Under `Live run progress and cancel a running job`, add "(cancel done in v1 as Stop; live step progress is out of scope)".
- Add the future phases as unchecked items:
  - Pause and Resume (BeforeStep hook, screenshot on pause, time limit, fail open);
  - Stop followed by a resuming re-run, plus "Re-run failures";
  - a GitHub App instead of the personal token;
  - run parameters, scheduled runs, and more CI providers;
  - a dedicated execution-service.

- [ ] **Step 9: Run every check and confirm it passes.**

Run: `node --test templates/github/qa-vision-run.test.mjs`, then `cd dashboard && npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npx vitest run && npm run build && node --test ../templates/github/qa-vision-run.test.mjs`
Expected: PASS, with pristine output.

- [ ] **Step 10: Commit.**

```bash
FILES="templates/github/qa-vision-run.yml templates/github/qa-vision-run.mjs templates/github/qa-vision-run.test.mjs dashboard/src/templates/qa-vision-run.yml.txt dashboard/src/templates/qa-vision-run.mjs.txt dashboard/src/templates/templates.test.ts dashboard/src/components/CiTargetCard.tsx dashboard/src/components/CiTargetCard.test.tsx dashboard/src/index.css .github/workflows/ci.yml TODO.md"
git add $FILES && git commit -m "feat: qa-vision-run workflow template for the test repo, with its help block; TODO" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>" -- $FILES
```

---

## After all tasks: end to end (manual, needs the user)

This is the spec's "End to end" check. It is not a task: it needs the user's GitHub token and the user's change to the OBT repository.

1. `TM_SECRETS_KEY` is in `.env` (Task 6 Step 3b). Then run `set -a; . ./.env; set +a; docker compose up -d --build --wait` and `bash scripts/smoke_gateway.sh`. Never use `down -v`.
2. The user copies `templates/github/qa-vision-run.yml` and `.mjs` into the OBT repository on its default branch. The user adds `QAV_API_KEY` and `QAV_URL` there, with the tunnel's public URL, because hosted runners cannot reach localhost.
3. An owner saves `owner/Atriis.Test.Automation.OBT`, `qa-vision-run.yml`, the branch and the token in Settings. The card reads "Connected: … · token …xxxx · expires …".
4. Run a full import of OBT's `.feature` files, which fills `scenario_name`.
5. Press Run on one OBT case.
   - The panel goes from "Queued" to "Running · 1 test · …", then to "Passed" or "Failed".
   - "View in GitHub" opens the run.
   - The panel then links the results, and they appear in Last runs.
6. Press Run on a second case and Stop it. The panel ends on "Stopped by <you>".

## Future phases (not in v1, copied from the spec; no tasks)

1. **Pause and Resume.**
   - A cucumber `BeforeStep` hook in the customer repo asks QA Vision whether to continue. Pause holds before the next step, with the browser still open.
   - A screenshot taken on pause is sent to QA Vision.
   - A pause has a limit (for example 15 minutes) and then stops automatically.
   - The hook fails open: if QA Vision is unreachable, the test runs on.
2. **Stop followed by a resuming re-run**, built on Pause, plus "Re-run failures" of a finished run.
3. **A GitHub App** instead of the personal token: short-lived installation tokens owned by no single person. This is the TODO item "connect repository".
4. **Run parameters** (environment, workers, retries), scheduled runs, and more CI providers (GitLab, Azure Pipelines).
5. **A dedicated `execution-service`** once execution outgrows test-management.

## Self-review (done while writing)

- **Spec coverage:**

  | Spec part | Task |
  |---|---|
  | Migration 004 and `scenario_name` | 1 |
  | Token encryption and GitHub client | 2 |
  | `ci-target` endpoints, saving a target, the events, PUT, GET and DELETE | 3 |
  | Starting a run, 412, 422, the 409 refresh, dispatch with `return_run_details` (run id stored at Play on 200), polling, the 204 fallback (title matching and 2-min `failed_to_start`), the status map | 4 |
  | Stop at once with the run id from Play; the 204 fallback for a queued request with no run id | 5 |
  | Gateway, smoke, README (endpoints, `TM_SECRETS_KEY`, default branch, security note) and `.env.example` | 6 |

- **Placeholders:** none. Every code step carries the code. The two conditional instructions (httpx byte serialisation, fake timers) give the exact fallback.
- **Type consistency:**
  - `RunRequestOut` fields match the TS `RunRequest`.
  - `refreshing` is used by `useLatestRunRequest`, `RunPanel` and `RequestedRunsPage`.
  - The query keys `["ci-target", id]`, `["run-requests", id, "latest"]` and `["project", id]` are shared across Tasks 7–9.
  - `github_failure` is defined in Task 3 and imported in Tasks 4 and 5.
  - `_match` and `_apply_github` are defined in Task 4 and replaced in Task 5.
  - `DispatchResult(run_id, html_url)` is defined in Task 2 and consumed by `create` in Task 4. `safe_run_url` is used for both the dispatch `html_url` and a matched run's `html_url`. The `github.dispatch(run_id=...)` stub (200) and `github.dispatch()` stub (204) are used the same way in Tasks 2, 4 and 5.
- **Review Focus:** five lines, each pinned by a named test in its owning task.
  - Duplicate scenario names inside one file are already pinned by the existing parse test.
  - The cross-file case is Ruling 2.
