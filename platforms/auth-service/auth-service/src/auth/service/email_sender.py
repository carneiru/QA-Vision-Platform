"""Sends the email-verification and password-reset links.

SMTP_HOST and friends already existed in config.py, unread. Unlike Google SSO (which fails
closed with 503 when unconfigured -- verifying without an audience would be a worse hole
than refusing), this cannot fail closed: every development and test environment lacking a
real SMTP server would be unable to register at all, which is unacceptable for a control
this central. When SMTP_HOST is empty (the default), the link is logged instead of sent.
