"""SSO Service — real Google ID token verification.

This previously returned hardcoded identities for every provider (`user@gmail.com` and
friends) while the endpoint went on to mint real access and refresh tokens for whatever
that mock returned. Any credential string would have been accepted. It was never reachable
in practice only because this module's importers did not parse, but it was one syntax fix
away from being an unauthenticated login-as-anyone hole.

Google is now verified properly against Google's published signing keys. GitHub and Azure
are not implemented and their endpoints say so (501) rather than pretending.
