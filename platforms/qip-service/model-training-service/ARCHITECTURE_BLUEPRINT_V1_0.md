## 4. Domain-Driven Design & Bounded Contexts

Following Domain-Driven Design principles, QEOS is organized into eight core domains with clearly defined bounded contexts:

### Core Domains
1. **Platform Domain** - Authentication, organizations, projects, users, billing, subscriptions
2. **Execution Domain** - Test case management, test execution, environment provisioning, artifact handling
3. **Quality Intelligence Platform (QIP) Domain** - Knowledge objects, insights, patterns, recommendations, analytics
4. **Automation Domain** - Workflow definitions, triggers, conditions, actions, execution engine
5. **Collaboration Domain** - Dashboards, reports, notifications, commenting, knowledge sharing
6. **Administration Domain** - User/role management, audit trails, compliance reporting, system configuration
7. **Marketplace Domain** - Plugin management, versioning, compatibility checking, extension framework
8. **Integrations Domain** - Standardized adapters for external systems (Jira, Jenkins, Slack, AWS, etc.)

### Shared Kernel
Cross-cutting concerns shared across all domains:
- Authentication and authorization frameworks
- Event messaging contracts (Kafka topics, schemas)
  - Logging, monitoring, and tracing standards (see Section 11)
- Configuration management
- Error handling patterns
- Validation utilities
- Deployment and release tooling

Each domain maintains its own ubiquitous language and implements anti-corruption layers at boundaries to prevent domain model contamination.

---

## 5. Data Architecture

QEOS implements a stratified data architecture that flows from operational systems to intelligent insights:

### Data Flow Layers
```
Operational Databases
        ↓ (CDC - Change Data Capture)
   Event Store (Apache Kafka)
        ↓
    Data Lake (MinIO/S3)
        ↓
  Data Warehouse (ClickHouse)
        ↓
Embedding Store (Qdrant/Pinecone)
        ↓
  Knowledge Graph (Neo4j)
        ↓
AI Runtime & Analytics Engines
```

### Storage Technology Selection
| Data Type | Technology | Consistency | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|-------------|---------|
| User/Tenant/Data | PostgreSQL 15.x | Strong (ACID) | Accounts, tenants, projects, roles, permissions, billing |
| Test Cases/Executions | PostgreSQL 15.x | Strong (ACID) | Test artifacts, execution records, environment metadata |
| Knowledge Objects | MongoDB 7.0 | Eventual | Flexible schema for insights, patterns, recommendations |
| Knowledge Graph | Neo4j 5.12 | Strong (Single) | Relationship traversal, influence mapping, recommendations |
| Vector Embeddings | Qdrant 1.7+ | Eventual | Semantic search, similarity matching, clustering |
| Analytics Warehouse | ClickHouse 24.3 | Strong within partition | Aggregated metrics, trend analysis, reporting |
| Event Streaming | Apache Kafka 3.6 | At-least-once | Inter-domain communication, event souring, CQRS |
| Caching Layer | Redis 7.2 | Eventual | Session storage, rate limiting, computed value caching |
| Object Storage | MinIO | Eventually consistent | Execution artifacts, logs, screenshots, videos, backups |
| Search Engine | Elasticsearch 8.12 | Eventually inconsistent | Full-text search, log analysis, audit querying |
| Time Series DB | Prometheus 2.50 | Eventually consistent | System and business metrics, alerting |

### Data Management Principles
- **Write Ownership**: Only the owning domain writes to its primary storage
- **Read Through APIs**: Domains read other domains' data exclusively through published APIs
- **Event-Driven Sync**: Changes propagate via domain events with eventual consistency
- **Schema Evolution**: Backward compatible changes with 1-year deprecation notices
- **Multi-tenancy**: Logical isolation via tenant_id at storage and API layers
- **Privacy by Design**: PII minimization, encryption, access controls, retention policies

---

## 6. Event Architecture

QEOS embraces event-driven architecture with Apache Kafka as the central nervous system for inter-domain communication.

### Event-Driven Principles
- **Decoupling**: Services communicate asynchronously through events
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of producers and consumers
- **Resilience**: Message persistence enables recovery from failures
- **Replayability**: Events can be reprocessed for new features or recovery
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of system changes for compliance

### Event Categories
1. **Commands** (Intent to Change State)
   - `CreateTestCase`, `StartTestExecution`, `GenerateInsight`, `StartWorkflowExecution`
   - Handled by specific domain services
   - Expect success/failure response

2. **Events** (Facts About What Happened)
   - `TestCaseCreated`, `ExecutionCompleted`, `InsightGenerated`, `WorkflowCompleted`
   - Published by domain of origin
   - Consumed by interested parties for reactions, updates, or projections

3. **Queries** (Request for Information)
   - `GetTestCase`, `GetExecutionStatus`, `SearchKnowledge`
   - Typically handled via synchronous APIs (REST/gRPC) for immediate response

### Event Schema Standards
All events follow a standardized envelope:
```json
{
  "eventId": "uuid",
  "eventType": "string (domain.action.version)",
  "eventVersion": "string (semver)",
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601 timestamp",
  "producer": {
    "serviceName": "string",
    "serviceInstanceId": "string",
    "version": "string"
  },
  "correlationId": "string (optional)",
  "causationId": "string (optional)",
  "tenantId": "string",
  "payload": { /* domain-specific payload */ }
}
```

### Key Events by Domain

#### Execution Domain Events
- `testcase.created.v1` - New test case added
- `testcase.updated.v1` - Test case modified
- `execution.started.v1` - Test execution began
- `execution.completed.v1` - Test execution finished (terminal state)
- `execution.cancelled.v1` - Test execution manually cancelled
- `environment.provisioned.v1` - Test environment ready for use
- `artifact.uploaded.v1` - Execution artifact (log, video, etc.) stored

#### QIP Domain Events
- `knowledge.created.v1` - New knowledge object added
- `knowledge.updated.v1` - Knowledge object modified
- `knowledge.validated.v1` - Knowledge received human/system validation
- `insight.generated.v1` - AI produced new quality insight
- `pattern.discovered.v1` - ML identified recurring pattern
- `recommendation.made.v1` - System suggested improvement action

#### Automation Domain Events
- `workflow.created.v1` - New workflow definition registered
- `workflow.started.v1` - Workflow execution initiated
- `workflow.step.completed.v1` - Individual workflow step finished
- `workflow.completed.v1` - Workflow finished successfully
- `workflow.failed.v1` - Workflow execution encountered error
- `trigger.fired.v1` - Workflow trigger condition met
- `action.executed.v1` - Workflow action performed

### Delivery Guarantees
- **At-least-once delivery**: Ensures no event loss
- **Idempotent event handling**: Safe to process same event multiple times
- **Dead Letter Quarantine**: Repeatedly failing events moved for inspection
- **Schema Registry**: Apicurio Registry manages event schema evolution
- **Cross-Domain Consistency**: Saga patterns for transactions spanning domains

## 8. Internal Platform APIs & QIP

The Quality Intelligence Platform (QIP) serves as the central nervous system of QEOS, receiving events from all domains and distributing intelligence back to drive decisions and actions.

### QIP as Central Nervous System
```
All Domains ────→ [ Events → Kafka ] ────→ [ QIP Services ] ────→ [ Insights/Actions ] ←── All Domains
                                    ↑                                       ↓
                                    ←──── [ Commands/Queries ] ←───────────╯
```

### Information Flow Patterns
1. **Ingestion**: Domains publish events to Kafka topics
2. **Processing**: QIP services consume events, update knowledge base
3. **Analysis**: AI/ML engines detect patterns, generate insights, make predictions
4. **Distribution**: Insights published as events, available via APIs
5. **Action**: Domains consume insights to trigger workflows, adjust processes

### QIP Internal APIs

### 11.1 Logging Strategy
#### Structured Logging (JSON Format)
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "execution-service",
  "instanceId": "instance-123",
  "traceId": "trace-456",
  "spanId": "span-789",
  "traceFlags": "01",
  "userId": "user-789",
  "tenantId": "tenant-456",
  "correlationId": "corr-999",
  "message": "Test execution started",
  "context": {
    "executionId": "exec-123",
    "testCaseId": "tc-456",
    "trigger": "webhook",
    "environmentId": "env-789"
  }
}
```

#### Log Levels & Usage
- **FATAL**: Application cannot continue (pager alert)

- **WARN**: Potential issue needing attention (log-only for trend)
- **INFO**: Operational audit trail (retention: 90 days)
- **DEBUG**: Diagnostic information (development/temporary)
- **TRACE**: Verbose tracing (rarely enabled in prod)

#### Log Collection & Storage
- **Agents**: Promtail/Fluent Bit daemonset collecting container logs
- **Transport**: Secure forwarding to Loki cluster via gRPC
- **Storage**: Loki index and chunk storage with tenant labels
- **Retention**: 30 days hot, 90 days warm, 365 days cold (based on compliance)
- **Query Interface**: Grafana Explore, LogCLI, API access for alerting
- **Alerting**: Log-based alerts via Prometheus/Loki integration rules

### 11.2 Metrics Strategy
#### Metric Types (Prometheus Convention)

# 15. Bounded Context Map and Context Mapping

## 15.1 Context Overview

QA Vision is organized using Domain-Driven Design (DDD), where each bounded context represents an autonomous business capability with clearly defined responsibilities, ownership, APIs, events, and data models.

The platform consists of the following bounded contexts:

- Platform
- Integrations
- Execution
- Intelligence (QIP)
- Collaboration
- Administration
- Shared Kernel

Each context owns its domain model and communicates through well-defined contracts.

---

## 15.2 Context Relationships

| Provider | Consumer | Relationship | Communication |
|-----------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Platform | All Domains | Customer/Supplier | REST + Events |
| Execution | Intelligence | Customer/Supplier | Kafka Events |
| Intelligence | Collaboration | Published Language | Events |
| Collaboration | Administration | Partnership | REST |
| Integrations | Execution | ACL (Anti-Corruption Layer) | REST/Webhooks |
| Shared Kernel | All Domains | Shared Kernel | Libraries |

---

## 15.3 Context Mapping Patterns

The architecture adopts standard DDD context mapping patterns.

### Customer-Supplier

- Platform → All Domains
- Execution → Intelligence
- Intelligence → Collaboration

### Published Language

Kafka Event Schemas

OpenAPI Specifications

Shared DTO Contracts

### Anti-Corruption Layer

External systems are isolated through dedicated adapters.

Examples:

- GitHub
- GitLab
- Azure DevOps
- Jira
- Jenkins

No external domain model may leak into internal bounded contexts.

---

## 15.4 Shared Kernel

The Shared Kernel contains only cross-cutting concerns.

Included:

- Authentication libraries
- Common DTOs
- Event definitions
- Utility libraries
- Logging
- Configuration
- Metrics
- Error models

Business logic is never placed inside the Shared Kernel.

---

## 15.5 Evolution Strategy

Bounded contexts evolve independently.

Rules:

- Independent deployments
- Independent versioning
- Independent persistence
- Backward-compatible APIs
- Event versioning
- Consumer-driven contract testing

---

# 16. Governance
