## Platform

web

## Users

Two confirmed audiences, served equally:

- **QA / SDET engineers** triaging CI results daily: which tests failed, which
  are flaky, what regressed on which branch or environment. Per-test
  drill-down is their job.
- **Engineering managers** reading suite health weekly: pass-rate trends, run
  volume, flaky counts. Aggregates over drill-down.

## Product Purpose

QEOS ingests test results from any CI (JUnit XML, Cucumber and Playwright
JSON and more via the `qeos-collector` agent), stores them per project, and
turns them into analytics: trends, per-test statistics and history, run
comparison, failures grouped by cause, flaky-test detection with quarantine,
and a filterable, printable Report per period. It also keeps a test-case
catalogue in sync with the team's Gherkin features and starts runs in the
team's own GitHub Actions. Success: a team answers "what is broken, what is
flaky, what is getting worse" from one place instead of scrolling CI logs.

## Positioning

AI-powered test analysis is the destination (Phase 6: failure pattern
recognition, risk-based prioritization, predictive analytics — not yet
built). Today's honest claim: a self-hosted platform whose flaky detection
distinguishes **confirmed** flakiness (same commit + environment, both passed
and failed) from **suspected** (statistical flip rate) — present that
distinction, never blur it. Do not market AI capabilities that do not exist
yet.

## Operating Context

- Results arrive from CI (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure Pipelines,
  Jenkins) via the collector; engineers open the dashboard after a red build,
  a failure notification (Slack, Teams, email) or when a flaky ticket lands;
  managers open it in weekly reviews or read the weekly summary.
- Microservices behind one NGINX gateway: auth-service (JWT, MFA, Google and
  Microsoft SSO), organization-service (orgs, members, roles, invitations),
  project-service (projects, repositories, settings), ingestion-service (runs,
  results, analytics, report, notifications), test-management-service (cases,
  suites, Gherkin sync, runs from QEOS), `dashboard/` (React SPA).
- Everything is deployed as containers from the repository-root
  docker-compose (production: one VM behind a Caddy TLS edge); same-origin
  API at `/api/v1/*`.

## Capabilities and Constraints

- Analytics API (read-only apart from quarantine): trends by day, week or
  month in any IANA time zone; per-test list, history; flaky detection with
  `window_days` up to 90, served from daily rollups (3.9 s at 90 days on ~2M
  results, against 11.3 s live — see the ingestion README).
- Access model: organization membership grants project access; roles are
  owner/admin/member/viewer/billing_manager (viewers and billing managers
  read only).
- `test_key` values contain `/`, `::`, spaces — always URL-encoded.
- `pass_rate` is a 0..1 fraction or null; null renders as "—".
- Internal tool: every dashboard surface is an authenticated Operate
  surface. No marketing or landing pages are planned.

## Evidence on Hand

- Real ingested runs exist only in dev/test stacks; production data is
  per-deployment. Screens show real ingested data or honest empty states —
  never fabricated metrics, testimonials, or benchmarks.
- Benchmarks documented in `platforms/ingestion-service/README.md`.

## Product Principles

1. Truth over polish: numbers shown are exactly what the API computed;
   absence of data is shown as absence, not zero.
2. Triage speed first: an engineer lands on "what is broken now" in one
   screen; depth (history, commits) is one click away.
3. Confirmed vs suspected is a first-class distinction wherever flakiness
   appears.
4. Same platform truth for both audiences: managers get aggregates of the
   same data engineers drill into, not a separate metric set.
5. Self-hosted modesty: no claims (AI or otherwise) ahead of shipped
   capability.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

- WCAG AA: chart and table contrast meets AA; status is never conveyed by
  color alone (labels/legends always present); colorblind-validated status
  palette (passed #0ca30c, failed #d03b3b, errored #c4501f light / #ec835a
  dark, skipped #74879a light / #6f8396 dark; DESIGN.md holds the tokens).
- Dark and light mode are both first-class, following the OS preference.
